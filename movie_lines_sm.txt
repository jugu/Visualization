L1045 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ They do not!
L1044 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ They do to!
L985 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I hope so.
L984 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ She okay?
L925 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Let's go.
L924 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Wow
L872 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
L871 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ No
L870 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
L869 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Like my fear of wearing pastels?
L868 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ The "real you".
L867 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ What good stuff?
L866 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
L865 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
L864 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
L863 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ What crap?
L862 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ do you listen to this crap?
L861 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ No...
L860 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
L699 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ You always been this selfish?
L698 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ But
L697 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Then that's all you had to say.
L696 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Well, no...
L695 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
L694 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I was?
L693 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
L663 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Tons
L662 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Have fun tonight?
L578 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ I believe we share an art instructor
L577 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ You know Chastity?
L576 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
L575 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Hi.
L407 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
L406 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
L405 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
L404 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ She's not a...
L403 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
L402 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
L401 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Sure have.
L368 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
L367 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ How do you get your hair to look like that?
L366 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ You're sweet.
L365 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ You have my word.  As a gentleman
L364 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
L363 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ You got something on your mind?
L281 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Where?
L280 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ There.
L277 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Well, there's someone I think might be --
L276 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
L275 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Forget French.
L274 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ That's because it's such a nice one.
L273 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
L272 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
L271 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ C'esc ma tete. This is my head
L208 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Let me see what I can do.
L207 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
L206 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ That's a shame.
L205 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
L204 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Why?
L203 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
L202 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
L201 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Cameron.
L200 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
L199 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Forget it.
L198 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
L197 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
L196 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
L195 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
L194 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
L953 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I did.
L952 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
L660 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ I don't have to be home 'til two.
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I have to be home in twenty minutes.
L600 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
L599 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
L598 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
L597 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
L596 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ Is he oily or dry?
L595 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
L580 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
L579 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ Great
L573 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Joey.
L572 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ Who?
L571 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Where did he go?  He was just here.
L51 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ You might wanna think about it
L50 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ No.
L49 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Did you change your hair?
L760 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
L759 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
L758 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
L757 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Hi, Joey.
L756 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Hey, sweet cheeks.
L593 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
L592 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Neat...
L591 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
L590 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Queen Harry?
L589 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
L397 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Hopefully.
L396 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
L395 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Expensive?
L394 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ It's more
L1052 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Perm?
L1051 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Patrick -- is that- a.
L1022 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ It's just you.
L1021 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
L1011 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ No! I just wanted
L1010 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
L1009 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I just wanted --
L1008 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You set me up.
L1007 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Let go!
L983 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ So did you
L982 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ You looked beautiful last night, you know.
L914 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I guess I'll never know, will I?
L913 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
L912 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
L911 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I guess I thought I was protecting you.
L910 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
L909 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ That's not
L908 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
L907 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
L906 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me?
L905 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
L904 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ But
L903 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
L902 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ You did what?
L901 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
L900 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ As in...
L899 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
L898 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ But you hate Joey
L897 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ He was, like, a total babe
L896 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Why?
L895 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ In 9th.  For a month
L894 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ What?
L893 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Joey never told you we went out, did he?
L892 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
L891 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
L890 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Like you care.
L889 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
L656 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You're welcome.
L655 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
L602 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
L601 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
L543 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Can we go now?
L542 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ You are so completely unbalanced.
L533 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
L532 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
L531 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
L530 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
L529 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
L527 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
L526 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What's normal?
L525 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
L445 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
L444 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What do you think?
L443 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
L442 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
L441 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
L320 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Can you at least start wearing a bra?
L319 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
L165 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
L164 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Where've you been?
L923 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
L922 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I'm missing something.
L884 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
L883 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
L882 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
L881 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
L880 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ No, but
L879 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ The prom?  Kat has a date?
L878 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
L546 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Because she'll scare them away.
L545 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Why?
L544 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
L540 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Just for a minute
L539 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Daddy, no!
L538 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Wear the belly before you go.
L537 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ It's just a party. Daddy.
L536 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Oh, God.  It's starting.
L524 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ If Kat's not going, you're not going.
L523 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Daddy, people expect me to be there!
L521 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
L520 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Otherwise known as an orgy?
L519 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
L518 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ And where're you going?
L517 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Daddy, I --
L190 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Exactly my point
L189 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ But she doesn't want to date.
L183 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
L182 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
L181 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ What if she never starts dating?
L180 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
L179 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
L463 +++$+++ u1 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Just sent 'em through.
L462 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
L461 +++$+++ u1 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Never
L460 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
L459 +++$+++ u1 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
L458 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Always a pleasure, Brucie.
L779 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
L778 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
L586 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ No, I ' m not.
L585 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
L584 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
L583 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
L500 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
L499 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You told me that part already.
L433 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ It's her favorite band.
L432 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Assail your ears for one night.
L425 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Okay!  I wasn't sure
L424 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He's pretty!
L419 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Dead at forty-one.
L418 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Her favorite uncle
L417 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's a lung cancer issue
L416 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Number one.  She hates smokers
L391 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
L390 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Will Bogey get bent?
L389 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
L388 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
L245 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
L244 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ You got him involved?
L225 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
L224 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ I thought you hated those people.
L223 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
L222 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ That's what I just said
L221 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
L220 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
L219 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
L218 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
L217 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
L216 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ He seems like he thrives on danger
L215 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What makes you think he'll do it?
L213 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You wanna go out with him?
L212 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ What about him?
L211 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
L210 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
L159 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
L158 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ That's her?  Bianca's sister?
L157 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
L147 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You could consecrate with her, my friend.
L146 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
L145 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
L144 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
L143 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You know French?
L142 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
L141 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ He always have that shit-eating grin?
L140 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
L139 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
L92 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
L91 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Why not?
L90 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
L89 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Who is she?
L88 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You burn, you pine, you perish?
L87 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ That girl -- I --
L78 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
L77 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ That I'm used to.
L74 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Couple thousand. Most of them evil
L73 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ How many people go here?
L72 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Get out!
L71 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Thirty-two.
L70 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How many people were in your old school?
L69 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
L68 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I was kidding. People actually live there?
L67 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ North, actually.  How'd you   ?
L66 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ So -- which Dakota you from?
L65 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
L64 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ So they tell me...
L63 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You the new guy?
L781 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ You get the girl.
L780 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What's the worst?
L745 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Where?
L744 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ She kissed me.
L743 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You makin' any headway?
L741 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
L740 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
L726 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
L725 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ What'd you do to her?
L625 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Then, go get her
L624 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Sure
L623 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Cameron -- do you like the girl?
L622 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ She's partial to Joey, not me
L621 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What 're you talking about?
L620 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ It's off. The whole thing.
L619 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Cameron, I'm a little busy
L431 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Don't make me do it, man
L430 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
L427 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
L426 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
L412 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
L411 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What've you got for me?
L386 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yeah -- we'll see.
L385 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
L558 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ And why would I do that?
L557 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Leave my sister alone.
L556 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Your sister here?
L555 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Away.
L554 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Where ya goin?
L336 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Not at all
L335 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Hey -- do you mind?
L150 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ They're running the rest of me next month.
L149 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
L148 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
L748 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
L747 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
L609 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Get her to act like a human
L608 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Do what?
L607 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ How'd you do it?
L606 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ A deal's a deal.
L605 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ It's about time.
L358 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Forget her sister, then.
L357 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Forget it.
L356 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ A hundred bucks a date.
L355 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What?
L354 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I just upped my price
L352 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
L351 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
L350 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I'm on it
L349 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
L301 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Fifty, and you've got your man.
L300 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
L299 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Fine, thirty.
L298 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
L297 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ How much?
L296 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
L295 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
L294 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
L292 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
L291 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You need money to take a girl out
L290 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You just said
L289 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
L288 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
L287 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Two legs, nice rack...
L286 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What do you think?
L285 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yeah
L509 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
L508 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
L505 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
L504 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You and Verona?
L503 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
L502 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I hear you're helpin' Verona.
L240 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
L239 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Does this conversation have a purpose?
L238 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
L236 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ We're not.
L235 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
L234 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ We don't chat.
L233 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Nope - just came by to chat
L232 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Are you lost?
L231 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey.
L949 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
L948 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ William - he asked me to meet him here.
L947 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Who?
L946 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Have you seen him?
L755 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
L754 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
L753 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
L752 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
L751 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
L750 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
L721 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
L720 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ You didn't
L719 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
L718 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
L717 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I didn't have a choice.
L716 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
L491 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Who cares?
L490 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ What'd he say?
L448 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ No fear.
L447 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ You think this'll work?
L254 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
L253 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Does it matter?
L252 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
L251 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Neither has his heterosexuality.
L250 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ That's never been proven
L249 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ William didn't even go to high school
L248 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ William would never have gone to a state school.
L247 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
L152 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
L151 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
L134 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
L133 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
L132 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ An attempted slit.
L131 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What's this?
L130 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Just a little.
L129 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
L128 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Block E?
L127 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ He always look so
L126 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
L125 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
L124 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Patrick Verona   Random skid.
L123 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Who's that?
L1043 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Don ' t you even dare. . .
L1042 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
L1041 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Because I like to torture you.
L1040 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
L1035 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
L1034 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Is that right?
L1033 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
L1032 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
L1031 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ A Fender Strat. You bought this?
L977 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I didn't care about the money.
L976 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
L975 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ It wasn't like that.
L974 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
L973 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Wait I...
L961 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
L960 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ That ' s completely adorable!
L959 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
L958 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What?
L957 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ My grandmother's .
L940 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
L939 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Oh huh
L938 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ It's just something I had.  You know
L937 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
L936 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
L857 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
L856 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Answer the question, Patrick
L855 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
L854 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You tell me.
L853 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ So I have to have a motive to be with you?
L852 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
L848 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
L847 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Why not?
L846 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ No, I won't go with you
L845 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ No what?
L844 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ No.
L843 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You know what I mean
L842 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Is that a request or a command?
L841 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Go to the prom with me
L840 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
L839 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ No one else knows
L838 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What?
L837 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
L836 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
L835 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I hate peas.
L834 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Tell me something true.
L832 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I know the porn career's a lie.
L831 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Hearsay.
L830 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ The duck?
L829 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Fallacy.
L828 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ State trooper?
L825 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ For. . . ?
L824 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You up for it?
L823 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You never disappointed me.
L822 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ How?
L821 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Then you screwed up
L820 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Something like that
L819 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
L818 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
L817 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yes
L816 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Acting the way we do.
L815 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ So what's your excuse?
L814 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Yeah, well, don't let it get out
L813 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ A soft side? Who knew?
L812 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I dazzled him with my wit
L811 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
L810 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Good call.
L809 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
L808 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ The Partridge Family?
L806 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Maybe.
L805 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
L804 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
L803 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Put your right foot there --
L802 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Try lookin' at it from this angle
L801 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ C'mon.  It's not that bad
L800 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
L799 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Look up, sunshine
L798 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
L774 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
L773 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ So what did I have an effect on ?
L772 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
L771 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
L770 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Unwelcome.
L769 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Wholesome.
L768 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Pleasant?
L767 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You 're so --
L766 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I heard there was a poetry reading.
L765 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L764 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
L690 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
L689 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ BIANCA
L688 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Who?
L687 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
L686 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
L684 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I'm gettin' there
L683 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Oh, so now you think you know me?
L682 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
L681 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ My father wouldn't approve of that that
L680 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Start a band?
L679 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ This.
L678 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Do what?
L677 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I should do this.
L676 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Why'd you lie?
L675 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Then why'd you ask?
L674 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ No, you weren't
L673 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Maybe.
L672 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Were you in jail?
L671 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Busy
L670 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ When you were gone last year -- where were you?
L669 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
L668 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ And I'm in control of it.
L651 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What?
L650 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Kat! Wake up!
L646 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You know what they say
L645 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I thought you were above all that
L644 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
L643 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
L642 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I hate him.
L641 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Dorsey.
L640 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Who?
L639 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Why'd you let him get to you?
L636 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Just let me sit down.
L635 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
L634 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Like you could find one
L633 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
L632 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Why?
L631 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Sure, I do
L630 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You don't care if I die
L629 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I told you
L628 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Why 're you doing this?
L627 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
L626 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ This is so patronizing.
L616 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
L615 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I know, just let me sleep
L614 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
L613 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I just need to lie down for awhile
L612 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You're not okay.
L611 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I'm fine. I'm
L610 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Okay?
L567 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Funny, you're the only one
L566 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I say, do what you wanna do.
L565 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ "I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
L564 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What's this?
L483 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Why, don't you?
L482 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You know who The Raincoats are?
L481 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
L477 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
L476 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ That's what you want, isn't it?
L475 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Excuse me?
L474 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ 
L473 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ hey.  Great show, huh?
L334 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
L333 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You're not a big talker, are you?
L332 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Hi
L331 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
L330 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Are you following me?
L328 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Seven-thirty?
L327 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You -- covered in my vomit.
L326 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
L325 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ And why would I do that?
L324 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
L323 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
L322 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You hate me don't you?
L313 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I know a lot more than that
L312 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
L311 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
L310 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Oh, right.  Friday.
L309 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Pick you up Friday, then
L307 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ My mission in life.
L306 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ There's a way to get a guy's attention.
L305 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
L304 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
L1000 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
L999 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ When I go?
L998 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
L997 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ No -- impressed.
L996 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
L995 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Bianca did what?
L994 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
L993 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Which parts?
L992 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Parts of it.
L991 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
L990 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ No, Daddy.
L989 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
L988 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Funny.
L987 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
L986 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Was that your sister?
L347 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
L346 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
L345 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ So what I want doesn't matter?
L344 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ As a parent, that's my right
L343 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Because you're making decisions for me.
L342 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Why can't we agree on this?
L341 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I thought you were punishing me.
L340 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
L339 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Then tell them I had a seizure.
L338 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ My insurance does not cover PMS
L185 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Enough!
L184 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
L174 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You decided.
L173 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
L172 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I know.
L1018 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ Just smack her now.
L1017 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
L109 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
L108 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Tempestuous?
L107 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
L106 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
L105 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
L104 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
L103 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
L738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Yeah...
L737 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Kat a fan, too?
L736 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Right.
L735 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Macbeth, right?
L733 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Oh yeah.
L732 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ You think?
L731 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Yeah.  I guess.
L730 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Cool pictures.  You a fan?
L729 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Hi.
L728 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
L777 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
L776 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Sweet love, renew thy force!
L775 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You were right. She's still pissed.
L724 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
L723 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ So you got cozy with she who stings?
L437 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I'm likin' you guys better
L436 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
L429 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yeah.
L428 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Ever been to Club Skunk?
L421 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Just for now.
L420 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
L415 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Good enough.
L414 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What?!
L384 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ We're your guys.
L383 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
L382 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
L381 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ So Dorsey can get the girl?
L380 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
L379 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
L378 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
L377 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
L376 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
L375 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What plan?
L373 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
L372 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What?
L371 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Say it
L512 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ See you next week!
L511 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ You're completely demented.
L264 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
L263 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
L262 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What's to discuss?
L261 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
L259 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
L258 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Touch of the flu.
L257 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
L62 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ With the teeth of your zipper?
L61 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
L60 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
L59 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I missed you.
L933 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ That ' s what I thought
L932 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Absolutely not.
L931 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Did I have anything to say about it?
L930 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Your daughters went to the prom.
L929 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ What just happened?
L927 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ But -- who -- what --?
L926 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Have a great time, honey!
L918 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Dr. Ruth?
L917 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
L887 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
L886 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
L877 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Pirate -- no question.
L876 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
L193 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You're not helping.
L192 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Tumescent!
L191 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
L171 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
L170 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ What's a synonym for throbbing?
L162 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Make anyone cry today?
L161 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ In the microwave.
L2181 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
L2180 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
L2179 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ We should have seen land.
L2177 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ We'll all go crazy...
L2176 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ He's the devil's child...
L2175 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
L2174 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
L2173 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ What are you listening to, chicken ass?
L2172 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
L2171 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ The water's going putrid in the barrels.
L2170 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
L2025 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
L2024 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
L2023 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
L2022 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
L2020 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
L2019 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
L2016 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
L2015 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Is that all that interests you? Gold?
L2014 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
L2012 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ If they agree to follow me, yes.
L2011 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Your life, and that of others!
L2010 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
L2006 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Excellency, you are right.
L2005 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
L1993 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
L1992 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I am, Your Eminence
L1991 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
L1990 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
L1989 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
L2524 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
L2523 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
L2522 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You can see for yourself.
L2275 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
L2274 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
L2031 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
L2030 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
L2029 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
L2028 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ The Judgment is ours!
L2027 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
L2540 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
L2539 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ What is it, now?  Tell me...
L2538 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ I am busy inside.
L2537 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Can't you stay with us a little?
L2474 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
L2473 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ They took everything...
L2472 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ They tried... but I didn't let them.
L2471 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
L2320 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
L2319 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ You don't usually ask.
L2318 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
L2123 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ That's something you can't decide.
L2122 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I don't want you to wait for me.
L2121 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
L2119 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ Thank God...
L2118 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ She said yes.
L1986 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ I find that hard to believe.
L1985 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
L1984 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
L1983 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Are we going to argue?
L1982 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
L1981 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I haven't given you much of a life.
L1980 +++$+++ u14 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BEATRIX +++$+++ I know.
L1979 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I could be gone for years.
L2432 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ I am afraid this is not the worst news.
L2431 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
L2430 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
L2429 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ How far from here?
L2426 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
L2425 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ Viceroy of the West Indies.
L2424 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Appointment to what?
L2423 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ My letters of appointment.
L2422 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Yes... I remember...
L2421 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
L2293 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
L2292 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ May I ask by whom?
L2291 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
L2290 +++$+++ u15 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ BOBADILLA +++$+++ I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
L2552 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
L2551 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
L2550 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
L2549 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ He never had one... except aboard my ships!
L2548 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
L2547 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What does he say?
L2542 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
L2541 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What are you listening to?
L2501 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ There must be a passage to that other ocean.
L2500 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ Father...
L2485 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ Not bad.
L2484 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ How are you feeling, Fernando?
L2440 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ This time with me!
L2439 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I have to explore the mainland.
L2131 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
L2130 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
L2129 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
L2128 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ There'll be a time.
L2127 +++$+++ u17 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ FERNANDO +++$+++ I want to go with you!
L2469 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ All of them created by people like me.
L2468 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
L2467 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What do you see?
L2466 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Look out of that window.
L2465 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
L2464 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Call them.
L2463 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ All I have to do is call the guards.
L2301 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
L2300 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What...?  Do I have so many already?
L2299 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
L2297 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
L2296 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
L2295 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
L2287 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ ... for a commoner?
L2286 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ You defend yourself admirably...
L2282 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
L2281 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
L2110 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
L2109 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
L2108 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Then you are too ambitious.
L2107 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I'm not bargaining!
L2106 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
L2105 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
L2104 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ No?
L2103 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ No...
L2410 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ You never learned how to speak my language.
L2409 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
L2394 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ You did the same to your God!
L2393 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
L2343 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Ask him if he will help.
L2342 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ He understands.
L2341 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
L2260 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
L2259 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ Chief says...
L2258 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ ... and also to bring medicine.
L2257 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ Chief says -- he has a God.
L2256 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ To bring the word of God.
L2255 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ Why?
L2254 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Thousands.
L2253 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ Chief says -- how many?
L2251 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
L2250 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ Chief knows.
L2249 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Tell the Chief we thank him.
L2248 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ You come!  You speak first!
L2239 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ Island.  Far.
L2238 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
L2237 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ Say not here!  Cuba!
L2535 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
L2534 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Oh?  So you are a new man?
L2533 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ New worlds create new people.
L2532 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ I knew you would.
L2531 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I have to disagree.
L2526 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You'll always be older than me, Father.
L2525 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ I suppose we're both old men now.
L2145 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Give me absolution.
L2144 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ I believed in you...
L2143 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You are bound by an oath, Father.
L2142 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
L2141 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
L2140 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
L2139 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
L2138 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ How long?
L2137 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
L2136 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ What are you saying?
L2135 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
L2134 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ I am listening, my son.
L2133 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
L2132 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
L2046 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Colon!  Don't!
L2045 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ All of them!  Just lies!
L2042 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
L2041 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Colon!
L2040 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Damn God!
L2039 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ If God intends you to go, then you will go.
L2038 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
L2037 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
L1969 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
L1968 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
L1967 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
L1966 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Passion is something one cannot control!
L1965 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Father Marchena!
L1964 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
L1963 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
L1962 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ So was Christ!
L1961 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Esdras is a Jew.
L1960 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
L1959 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ How can you be so certain?
L1958 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
L1957 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
L1952 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
L1951 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Why do you wish to sail west?
L1950 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
L1949 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ How did you manage it?
L1948 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ That's what it says.
L1947 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ God... That's in a week!
L1943 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
L1942 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
L2459 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
L2458 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
L2457 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Thank you.
L2456 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
L2280 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
L2279 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Do they have such thoughts?
L2086 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
L2085 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ How old are you, Senor Colon?
L2082 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ A woman?
L2081 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
L2080 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
L2079 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ May I speak freely?
L2077 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Surely you can do anything you want.
L2076 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
L2075 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ That she was impregnable.
L2074 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What did they say about Granada before today?
L2073 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ The ocean is uncrossable?
L2072 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
L2071 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
L2389 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ You will regret this.
L2388 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
L2387 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ Savagery is what monkeys understand.
L2386 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
L2348 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
L2347 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
L2346 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ My horse doesn't work.
L2345 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ We can't raise the wheel without it.
L2333 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
L2332 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ We don't need to know.
L2331 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
L2329 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
L2328 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
L2278 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
L2277 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
L2492 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ We can't be.
L2491 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
L2490 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ What's he doing?
L2165 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ Twenty eight.
L2164 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What do you read?
L2160 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Come over here.
L2159 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
L2158 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ And what do you think Mendez?
L2157 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
L2155 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ God be with us admiral.
L2154 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
L2211 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You're right.  Let the men decide.
L2210 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ You tell that to them!
L2209 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
L2208 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ You bloody...
L2207 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
L2206 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
L2205 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
L2204 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
L2203 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ The land is there.  I know it!
L2202 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ We're lost!
L2201 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You think I don't know that?
L2200 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
L2199 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
L2198 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ You must be mad...!
L2197 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Six days ago, yes.
L2196 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
L2065 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ Immediately.
L2064 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Where can I meet this man?
L2462 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Because he is not afraid of me.
L2461 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Then why?
L2460 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
L2419 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ And who would you think of, for such a task?
L2418 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ He must be replaced.
L2417 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
L2415 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Is this true, Brother Buyl?
L2414 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ ... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
L2377 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
L2376 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
L2116 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
L2115 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ ... Into a monk...
L2113 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
L2112 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
L1931 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Yes, Your Majesty.
L1930 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
L3546 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
L3545 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ ...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
L3497 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
L3496 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I'm abused.  Don't you think?
L3493 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Can I see your back?
L3492 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Out on my back when I was a small boy.
L3491 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Your father put cigarettes out on you?
L3490 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
L3489 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
L3488 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
L3487 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
L3486 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Back in the Czech Republic?
L3485 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
L3484 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Your mother was blind?
L3483 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
L3482 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
L3481 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Give me another one, please.
L3480 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
L3479 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ What else do you need?
L3478 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
L3477 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
L3476 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ But it's...
L3475 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ No.  No way.
L3474 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I would say...half.  Half is fair.
L3473 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ What's your cut?  How much?
L3472 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
L3471 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
L3470 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
L3469 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ No, he is here.  Shit...
L3468 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
L3467 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ What about Oleg?
L3466 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
L3465 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I was all of these.
L3464 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ ...delusions and paranoia.
L3461 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Oh, sure.
L3460 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ You bring the cigarettes?
L3459 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
L3396 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
L3395 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yes.  Yes, come with me!
L3394 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I'm coming with you.
L3393 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Where are we going?
L3392 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Don't say anything.
L3385 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ He has the camera!  He took the movie!
L3384 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
L3383 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Oh no!  No!  Shit!
L3382 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Here.  I have your money.
L3381 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
L3380 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
L3517 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Daphne, I...
L3516 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ I don't want to drag you down with me.
L3515 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ ...Do you really want me to forget about you?
L3514 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
L3330 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Pouring it out!
L3329 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L3318 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ I'll get my clothes.
L3317 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I'll make some for us.
L3316 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ In the kitchen.
L3315 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Do you have coffee?
L3314 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Right.
L3313 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You better get packed.
L3311 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I'm glad I met you.
L3310 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
L3309 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
L3308 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
L3307 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
L3306 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
L3305 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Is he your boyfriend?
L3302 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L3301 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
L3300 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Are you alright?
L3181 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
L3180 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ They're not gonna send you right back.
L3179 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
L3178 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I know.
L3177 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
L3170 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I'm just trying to find out who you are.
L3169 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ What are you asking me?
L3168 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ So you were never a prostitute?
L3167 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
L3166 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ No.
L3165 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ What about back home?
L3164 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ No.
L3163 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Did you ever turn tricks before?
L3162 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Yes, I considered it.
L3161 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You considered becoming a prostitute?
L3160 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Yeah.  This way.
L3159 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ So...the station is empty?
L3158 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
L3097 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Somewhere else?
L3096 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I can't take you to my place.
L3095 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
L3094 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Divorced.
L3093 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Are you married?
L3092 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ They won't until this is over.
L3091 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ I will if they don't send me back.
L3090 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
L3089 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Now I become custody of police department?
L3061 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Yes, but he was a cop.
L3060 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
L3059 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ ...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
L3065 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
L3064 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
L3063 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
L3062 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ A cop?
L3056 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
L3055 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
L3051 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
L3050 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ If I tell you, will you arrest me?
L3049 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
L3048 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Go on.
L3047 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
L3046 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
L3045 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
L3214 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
L3213 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
L3212 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Oh yeah...?  Alright.
L3211 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
L3210 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
L3209 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ It was my decision, not his.
L3208 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Oh.
L3506 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
L3505 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ But Chief?  Over this??
L3504 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
L3503 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ End my career?
L3502 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
L3501 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
L3500 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
L3499 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
L3498 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
L3294 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Okay.  But not water sports.
L3293 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Chief - mind if I take her?
L3203 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
L3202 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ No!  Nothing happened.
L3201 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
L3200 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I let her take a shower.
L3199 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
L3198 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
L3197 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
L3196 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
L2800 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ 'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
L2799 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
L2798 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Who do you think, Chief?!
L2797 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Who did cause and origin?
L3292 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Yeah.
L3291 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
L3290 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
L3289 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
L2805 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
L2804 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
L2803 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ What was that, Korfin?
L2802 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L2801 +++$+++ u28 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DUFFY +++$+++ Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
L3028 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
L3027 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
L3023 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No.  I'm okay.
L3022 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Are you hit?
L3017 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Stay with her.
L3016 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
L2938 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
L2937 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah.
L2936 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Only one guys checked in?
L2925 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ It's okay.
L2924 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Sorry...PD only.
L2923 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
L2922 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Any I.D.?
L2921 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Takin' a bath.
L2920 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Where is she?
L2752 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ A timer.
L2751 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What's he looking for?
L2633 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You ready?
L2632 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Tomorrow.  At lunch.
L2631 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ When?
L2630 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm gonna propose.
L2603 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
L2602 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
L2601 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
L2600 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Vodka tonic.
L2599 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
L2990 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
L2989 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
L2988 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
L2987 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Describe him.
L2986 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
L2981 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
L2980 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What are you saying?
L2979 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
L2978 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Did you tell him you did?
L2977 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No.
L2976 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
L2975 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
L2973 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
L2972 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
L2971 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What's wrong?
L2967 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
L2966 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
L2965 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
L2964 +++$+++ u44 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Who's there?
L3230 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
L3229 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
L3228 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
L3227 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
L3226 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
L3225 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
L3224 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
L3223 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
L3222 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Just a shower?
L3221 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I took her there for a shower and that's it.
L3220 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
L3219 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
L3082 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
L3081 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Hey.  I'm a professional.
L3080 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
L3079 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You know what I'm saying here.
L3078 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
L3077 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
L3076 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ So am I.
L3075 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I'm serious here.
L3074 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ My point exactly.
L3073 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I don't have a girlfriend.
L3072 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What would your girlfriend think of that?
L3071 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L3070 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You wanna talk to her alone?
L3069 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
L3068 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Raw deal.
L3067 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
L3058 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Something back home?
L3057 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Why not?
L3054 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Is that all there is?
L3053 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
L3052 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
L2999 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
L2998 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
L2997 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
L2996 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Of course.
L2995 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
L2994 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I'm on duty.
L2993 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You thirsty?
L2992 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
L2991 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
L2963 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Better than one.
L2962 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Two heads.
L2958 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I'll call it... tails.
L2957 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
L2956 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
L2955 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'll let you know what happens.
L2953 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ But what if it does?  You might need my help.
L2952 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ This has nothing to do with your fire.
L2951 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Mind if I ride along with you?
L2950 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You got any better ideas?
L2949 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You goin' to the escort service?
L2906 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Stay here.
L2905 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ My folks are.
L2904 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You're Polish?
L2903 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
L2902 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ This isn't homicide school.
L2901 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
L2900 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
L2899 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I'll come with you.
L2897 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
L2896 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
L2895 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
L2893 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
L2892 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What would you call her?
L2891 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Who says she's a suspect?
L2890 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
L2889 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Hmmmm.
L2888 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Pretty.
L2887 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
L2886 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
L2885 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
L2884 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
L2883 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Did you get a report from the M.E.?
L2882 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Good.  Good.  Commendable.
L2881 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I don't even watch TV.
L2880 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Nah, why should you?
L2879 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
L2878 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
L2877 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Nah, I musta missed it.
L2876 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Watch the news?
L2875 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
L2748 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
L2747 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No, what is it?
L2746 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You know what that is, right?
L2731 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
L2730 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
L3249 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
L3248 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
L3244 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
L3243 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
L3242 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
L3241 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Then do it, asshole.
L3240 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I kill someone famous.
L3239 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What's your accomplishment.
L3238 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
L3237 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What do you want?
L3236 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ So...who's Nicky?
L3157 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Don't be late.
L3156 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Thank you.
L3155 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ See you later.  Good luck.
L3154 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Okay.
L3153 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
L3152 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
L3151 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah.  I promise.
L3150 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ You promise?
L3149 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Tonight.
L3148 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Okay, til tonight.
L3147 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ I love you.
L3146 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
L3145 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
L3144 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
L3143 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Promise?
L3142 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
L3141 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
L3140 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
L3139 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
L3138 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, that's great.
L3137 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Yeah.
L3136 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ That's good.
L3135 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
L3130 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
L3129 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Answer it.
L3128 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ No.  Tell me what you want to say.
L3127 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Answer the phone.
L3126 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
L3121 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
L3120 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Could be Leon's.
L3119 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
L3117 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ You're not so bad yourself.
L3116 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You're ruthless.
L3115 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
L3114 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
L3113 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
L3112 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
L3111 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
L3110 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm not.
L3109 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
L3108 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
L3107 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Stop it.
L3106 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
L3105 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
L3104 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
L3103 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
L3102 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Hey.
L3101 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Hey, honey.
L3044 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Okay.
L3043 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Alright.
L3042 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Alright.
L3041 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Alright?
L3040 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Alright.
L3039 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
L3038 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Eddie, are you okay?
L3037 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Alright, cut, cut, cut.
L3036 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
L3035 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Do you have the suspect in custody?
L3034 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
L3033 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
L3032 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
L3031 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
L3030 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
L3029 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
L2765 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
L2764 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Is it drug related?
L2763 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
L2762 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Can we go up to the crime scene?
L2761 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ There are two bodies found at this point.
L2760 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ How many victims are up there?
L2759 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
L2758 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Detective, does it look like a murder?
L2665 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
L2664 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Any chance we can do that again?
L2656 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
L2655 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Okay.  You ready?
L2654 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Keep them out of my way.
L2653 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Ready?
L2652 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
L2651 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
L2648 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
L2647 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ That's unique.
L2646 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
L2645 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Not what.  Who.
L2644 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ So what's unique?
L2612 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
L2611 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How old are your kids?
L2607 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm not moody.
L2606 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
L2605 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
L2604 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Sooner or later that's everybody.
L2596 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Jesus Christ.
L2595 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
L2628 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ No.  Are you proposing?
L2627 +++$+++ u45 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ SECONDARY OFFICER +++$+++ Are you married?
L2626 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Dog food.
L2625 +++$+++ u45 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ SECONDARY OFFICER +++$+++ And what do you do with the bones?
L2624 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ You stuff sausage in it.
L2623 +++$+++ u45 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ SECONDARY OFFICER +++$+++ You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
L2622 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I am butcher.
L2621 +++$+++ u45 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ SECONDARY OFFICER +++$+++ Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
L3286 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
L3285 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
L3284 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
L3283 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ What?  It doesn't work that way.
L3282 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
L3281 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
L3280 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
L3279 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
L3278 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
L3556 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
L3555 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Let her go!  Let her go!!
L3554 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Tell him to put his gun down!
L3436 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
L3435 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Where's your partner?
L3434 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Get down on your knees.
L3433 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
L3432 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You'll be my first.
L3431 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
L3421 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Tommy, take a walk.
L3420 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
L3419 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
L2858 +++$+++ u32 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
L2857 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Give me the address!!

L2855 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
L2854 +++$+++ u32 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
L2853 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
L2852 +++$+++ u32 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
L2851 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Where is escort service?
L2850 +++$+++ u32 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
L2849 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
L2848 +++$+++ u32 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
L2847 +++$+++ u32 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
L2846 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Where's Czech girl?
L2845 +++$+++ u32 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ Hi, I'm Honey.
L2581 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ He doesn't speak English.
L2580 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
L2579 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Two weeks.
L2578 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ How long are you planning to stay?
L2577 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ We are both from Prague.
L2574 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
L2573 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Is there a problem?
L2572 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ Please join us.  Come on forward.
L2571 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yes.
L2570 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
L2569 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
L2568 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I have five-hundred dollars.
L2567 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ How much money are you carrying with you?
L2566 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Two weeks holiday.
L2565 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
L2564 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yes sir.
L2563 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
L2915 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yes.  Both.
L2914 +++$+++ u48 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ VENDOR +++$+++ Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
L2913 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
L2912 +++$+++ u48 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ VENDOR +++$+++ In here, says he wants a million.
L2911 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
L2910 +++$+++ u48 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ VENDOR +++$+++ This all you want?
L2909 +++$+++ u48 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ VENDOR +++$+++ New York's finest.  This is his case.
L2908 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Who is he?
L3548 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
L3547 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Traitor!!
L3378 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
L3377 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ No, I don't get that!
L3376 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ You got that?
L3375 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
L3374 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
L3373 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Credit?
L3372 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
L3370 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
L3369 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
L3368 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
L3366 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Be quiet.  Watch.
L3365 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
L3364 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Bad last moment - I cut it out.
L3363 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
L3362 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Shut up.  Look!
L3361 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I'm serious.
L3360 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
L3359 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
L3357 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
L3356 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
L3251 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Cut!
L3250 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
L3247 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Good idea!
L3246 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
L3193 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
L3192 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Sit down!
L3191 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Let me get a shot of it.
L3190 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ What does it look like?  It's an address book!
L3189 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ What is that?
L3188 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Put the camera down, Oleg.
L3187 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Why not?
L3186 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
L3185 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I did.
L3184 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
L3183 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ What is it?
L3088 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Don't want to film this?
L3087 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
L3085 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Does it hurt?
L3084 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Shut up.
L3083 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
L2844 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
L2843 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
L2842 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Get in the bathroom!
L2790 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
L2789 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Whore?
L2783 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
L2782 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ How you erase this?
L2781 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ You said speak Czech!
L2780 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Speak English!
L2779 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
L2778 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Turn that fucking thing off!
L2671 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
L2670 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ What?
L2668 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
L2667 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
L2666 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Turn that off!  Get the bags.
L2640 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ We have no money.  Come on.
L2639 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
L2638 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
L2637 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
L2636 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Don't speak Russian!
L2635 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
L2562 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I want to document my trip to America.
L2561 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Did you hear what I said?
L2560 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Okay.
L2559 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Don't fool around.
L2558 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Okay.
L2557 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
L2692 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
L2691 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ We started over, you can too.
L2690 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
L2689 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ It's easy to learn.
L2688 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ As a plumber?!
L2687 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ Yes, the money is good.
L2686 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ A job?
L2685 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ I can get you a job.
L2682 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
L2681 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Ha. Ha.
L2680 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ We spent it!
L2679 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Milos.  Get my money!
L2678 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
L2676 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
L2675 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ Did you hurt her?
L2674 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
L2673 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Surprise!  Surprise!
L2672 +++$+++ u39 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MILOS +++$+++ Emil???!
L3353 +++$+++ u37 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You want the tape?  There it is!
L3352 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Viewer discretion advised!
L3275 +++$+++ u37 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
L3274 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
L3273 +++$+++ u37 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You've got a call.
L3272 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L3271 +++$+++ u37 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Robert...?
L3413 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Don't give me that fucking shit.
L3412 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
L3411 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
L3410 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
L3409 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ And you, you'll pay for what you did!
L2615 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Paulie, you've got kids, right?
L2614 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah?
L2610 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ In love?  With who?
L2609 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
L2608 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Isn't he a little moody?
L3269 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
L3268 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
L3267 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Alright.  Go ahead.
L3266 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ I'm trying to tell you.
L3265 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ I want to hear everything he said.
L3264 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Well, he...
L3263 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
L3262 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ I know.
L2591 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ Excuse me?
L2590 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
L2589 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
L2588 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I'm here for movies.
L2587 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ What are you coming here to do?
L2586 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ A cheap hotel.
L2585 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
L2584 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ New York.
L2583 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
L2582 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ I speak English.
L2576 +++$+++ u33 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ IMMIGRATION OFFICER +++$+++ Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
L2575 +++$+++ u42 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ OLEG +++$+++ Yes...he's my friend.
L3403 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
L3402 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well, he killed my partner!
L3401 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ He's my collar!
L3400 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
L3399 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ No way!  He's mine!
L3398 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I'll take him.
L2745 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Evidence.  Of a homicide.
L2744 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What was that?
L2743 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
L2742 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
L2741 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ That's what it looks like to me.
L2740 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
L2733 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Thanks.  Appreciate it.
L2732 +++$+++ u36 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No.  Go ahead.
L2773 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
L2772 +++$+++ u40 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
L2771 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You okay?
L2707 +++$+++ u40 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
L2706 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I'll send a cop back for you.
L2703 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Oh yeah?  Guess again.
L2702 +++$+++ u40 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
L2701 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
L2700 +++$+++ u40 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
L2699 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
L2698 +++$+++ u40 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
L2813 +++$+++ u38 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
L2812 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Yeah?  What kind?
L2811 +++$+++ u38 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I used an accelerant.
L2810 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ How did you start the fire this time?
L2809 +++$+++ u38 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
L2808 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
L3344 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
L3343 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ What the hell happened?
L3342 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Get outta here!
L3288 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Not good.
L3287 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ How was it?
L3026 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
L3025 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
L3024 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
L2872 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
L2871 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Aren't you tired?
L2870 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
L2865 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ You hear that question, Garcia?
L2864 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ How long they been livin' here?
L2863 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ -- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
L2795 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Maybe you can be his stand-in.
L2794 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Yeah?
L2793 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
L2768 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
L2767 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ What?
L2757 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
L2756 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ What??
L2755 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ He knew all along.
L2754 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
L2739 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ But you knew that, right?
L2738 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
L2737 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Don't blow your nose!
L2736 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Clean?
L2735 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Mouth's clean, too.
L2725 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
L2724 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
L2721 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ 'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
L2720 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Oh yeah, why?
L2719 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
L2718 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
L2717 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
L2716 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
L2715 +++$+++ u35 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ KORFIN +++$+++ Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
L3427 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
L3426 +++$+++ u47 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
L3425 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
L3424 +++$+++ u47 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Don't stoop to his level!
L3423 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
L3422 +++$+++ u47 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ What are you gonna do?
L2930 +++$+++ u47 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ The clerk?
L2929 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
L2928 +++$+++ u47 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
L2840 +++$+++ u46 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ STEPHEN GELLER +++$+++ That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
L2839 +++$+++ u43 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROBERT HAWKINS +++$+++ But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
L2838 +++$+++ u46 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ STEPHEN GELLER +++$+++ We're in negotiations, that's correct.
L2837 +++$+++ u43 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROBERT HAWKINS +++$+++ And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
L2836 +++$+++ u46 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ STEPHEN GELLER +++$+++ Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
L2835 +++$+++ u43 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROBERT HAWKINS +++$+++ Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
L2834 +++$+++ u46 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ STEPHEN GELLER +++$+++ Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
L2833 +++$+++ u43 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROBERT HAWKINS +++$+++ You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
L2832 +++$+++ u46 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ STEPHEN GELLER +++$+++ It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
L2831 +++$+++ u43 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROBERT HAWKINS +++$+++ ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
L2830 +++$+++ u46 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ STEPHEN GELLER +++$+++ Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
L2829 +++$+++ u43 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ ROBERT HAWKINS +++$+++ Your doctor?
L2828 +++$+++ u46 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ STEPHEN GELLER +++$+++ This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
L3778 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
L3777 +++$+++ u49 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ B20 +++$+++ CONTINUED
L3771 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
L3770 +++$+++ u49 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ B20 +++$+++ CONTINUED
L3757 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ How did they manage to do that without any communication?
L3756 +++$+++ u49 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ B20 +++$+++ CONTINUED
L3750 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
L3749 +++$+++ u49 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ B20 +++$+++ CONTINUED
L3729 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ She's wonderful.
L3728 +++$+++ u49 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ B20 +++$+++ CONTINUED
L3721 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
L3720 +++$+++ u49 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ B20 +++$+++ CONTINUED
L3713 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
L3712 +++$+++ u49 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ B20 +++$+++ SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
L4300 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Roger.
L4299 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
L4298 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I guess not.
L4297 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
L4296 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
L4283 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
L4282 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ It's the last one.
L4209 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Yes.
L4208 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Hal?
L4199 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
L4198 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Two more.
L4197 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
L4196 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
L4193 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ No.
L4192 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ You're kidding.
L4191 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
L4190 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
L4189 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Are you reasonably awake?
L4188 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Good morning. How's it going?
L4163 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
L4162 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
L4161 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
L4160 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
L4159 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Well, that's something.
L4017 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
L4016 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I guess it isn't.
L4015 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
L4014 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ But not completely inconceivable?
L4013 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
L4012 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
L4011 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
L4001 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ That's true.
L4000 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
L3999 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ How?
L3998 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
L3997 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Yes, I thought so.
L3996 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ That seems very unlikely.
L3995 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
L3992 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
L3991 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
L3990 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
L3989 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Oh?
L3988 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
L3987 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I suppose the idea was specialized training.
L3984 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ No. I never did, either.
L3983 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
L3982 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
L3981 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
L3980 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ It's possible.
L3979 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
L3976 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
L3975 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Yes.
L3974 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Really.
L3973 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
L3972 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
L3969 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
L3968 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Yes?
L3967 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ It's about my salary cheques.
L3966 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ What's up?
L3965 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
L3964 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Sure, what is it?
L3963 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
L3945 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Okay, come on down.
L3944 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Okay. 
L3943 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Right. Just a sec.
L3942 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
L4368 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
L4367 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
L4366 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I am prepared to do that anyway.
L4363 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
L4362 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
L4361 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
L4360 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
L4357 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
L4356 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
L4355 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
L4354 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
L4353 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
L4350 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
L4349 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
L4348 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
L4347 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ The antenna has to be replaced.
L4346 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
L4335 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
L4334 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Yes, it is.
L4333 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
L4271 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
L4270 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Yes, it is, Hal.
L4269 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Is your confidence in me fully restored?
L4268 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ And don't you worry about it.
L4267 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Well, don't worry about it.
L4266 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
L4265 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
L4230 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
L4229 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
L4228 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
L4227 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
L4224 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
L4223 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ You probably also know that we found them okay.
L4222 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Yes, I know.
L4221 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
L4220 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Sure, Dave, what's up?
L4219 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
L4080 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
L4079 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
L4070 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
L4069 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ What is it, Hal?
L4068 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
L4007 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ He's got a point.
L4006 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
L4019 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
L4018 +++$+++ u51 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ C12 +++$+++ CONTINUED
L4010 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
L4009 +++$+++ u51 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ C12 +++$+++ CONTINUED
L4003 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
L4002 +++$+++ u51 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ C12 +++$+++ CONINUED
L3994 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Well, what is it?
L3993 +++$+++ u51 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ C12 +++$+++ CONTINUED
L3978 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Did they have any explanation for this?
L3977 +++$+++ u51 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ C12 +++$+++ CONTINUED
L3971 +++$+++ u50 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ BOWMAN +++$+++ Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
L3970 +++$+++ u51 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ C12 +++$+++ CONTINUED
L3693 +++$+++ u52 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ CHILD +++$+++ Goodbye, Daddy.
L3692 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ 'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
L3691 +++$+++ u52 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ CHILD +++$+++ Yes, Daddy.
L3690 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
L3689 +++$+++ u52 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ CHILD +++$+++ Thank you, Daddy.
L3688 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
L3685 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
L3684 +++$+++ u52 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ CHILD +++$+++ How many days until you come home?
L3683 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
L3682 +++$+++ u52 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ CHILD +++$+++ She's in the bathroom.
L3681 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Where is Mrs. Brown?
L3680 +++$+++ u52 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ CHILD +++$+++ Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
L3679 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
L3677 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ In three days, darling, I hope.
L3676 +++$+++ u52 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ CHILD +++$+++ When are you coming home?
L3675 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
L3674 +++$+++ u52 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ CHILD +++$+++ Are you coming to my party?
L3673 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Yes, I know that sweetheart.
L3672 +++$+++ u52 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ CHILD +++$+++ I'm having a party tomorrow.
L3669 +++$+++ u52 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ CHILD +++$+++ I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
L3668 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
L3810 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ I'll bet it's a fortune.
L3809 +++$+++ u53 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ CO-PILOT +++$+++ I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
L3808 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
L3807 +++$+++ u53 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ CO-PILOT +++$+++ Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
L3806 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
L3805 +++$+++ u53 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ CO-PILOT +++$+++ Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
L3799 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Well, how's it going back there?
L3798 +++$+++ u53 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ CO-PILOT +++$+++ Thank you.
L3797 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Oh, thank you very much.
L3780 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
L3779 +++$+++ u54 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
L3776 +++$+++ u54 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
L3775 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
L3774 +++$+++ u54 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
L3759 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Well, that does sound very odd.
L3758 +++$+++ u54 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
L3735 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Well, where are all of you off to?
L3734 +++$+++ u54 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
L3733 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ How is gregor?
L3732 +++$+++ u54 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Oh, that's such a delightful age.
L3731 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
L3730 +++$+++ u54 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ And your charming little daughter?
L3653 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Yes, it's coming along very well.
L3652 +++$+++ u58 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
L3651 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Yes, I think so. Just about then.
L3631 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Fine.
L3630 +++$+++ u58 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Well, shall we go through Documentation?
L3629 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Yes, very pleasant.
L3628 +++$+++ u58 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
L3627 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Please, it really doesn't matter.
L3626 +++$+++ u58 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
L3623 +++$+++ u58 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MILLER +++$+++ I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
L3622 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ How do you do, Mr. Miller?
L3773 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
L3772 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
L3768 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
L3767 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Certainly.
L3766 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
L3763 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Well, I'm glad about that.
L3762 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ Fortunately, they did.
L3761 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
L3760 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
L3754 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ I see.
L3753 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ That's right.
L3752 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
L3751 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
L3748 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
L3747 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Really?
L3746 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
L3745 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
L3740 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
L3739 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
L3738 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
L3726 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Yes, really, thank you very much.
L3725 +++$+++ u61 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ SMYSLOV +++$+++ Are you quite sure?
L3724 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
L3907 +++$+++ u57 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
L3906 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
L3905 +++$+++ u57 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
L3904 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Any ideas about the colour?
L3897 +++$+++ u57 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
L3896 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
L3893 +++$+++ u57 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
L3892 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Any clue as to what it is?
L3891 +++$+++ u57 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
L3890 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
L3889 +++$+++ u57 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
L3869 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
L3868 +++$+++ u57 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
L3839 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
L3838 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
L3837 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
L3834 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
L3833 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
L3832 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
L3829 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
L3828 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ I see.
L3827 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
L3826 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ What do you mean?
L3825 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
L3824 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Thank you.
L3821 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
L3820 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
L3819 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ When do we arrive at Clavius?
L3818 +++$+++ u59 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ PILOT +++$+++ There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
L3817 +++$+++ u55 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
L4183 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
L4182 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
L4181 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
L4175 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Let me see the tracking alignment display.
L4174 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
L4170 +++$+++ u56 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ HAL +++$+++ It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
L4169 +++$+++ u60 +++$+++ m3 +++$+++ POOLE +++$+++ Yes, Hal, what's up?

L4906 +++$+++ u63 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ I don't give a shit who you ask.
L4905 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
L4904 +++$+++ u63 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.

L4511 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
L4510 +++$+++ u64 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
L4509 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
L4508 +++$+++ u64 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I never paid for it in my life.
L4507 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ Yeah, dummy.  Money.

L4453 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
L5371 +++$+++ u65 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Now you're talkin'. See ya...

L5367 +++$+++ u65 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
L5366 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Here you go, baby.
L5216 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.

L5178 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
L5177 +++$+++ u65 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Hey, what kind of talk is that?
L5176 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
L5175 +++$+++ u65 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ I'm candy...
L5329 +++$+++ u66 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CASEY +++$+++ In the back.  Down the other corridor.
L5328 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Where's ganz?
L5325 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
L5324 +++$+++ u66 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CASEY +++$+++ No chance.
L5323 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You're gonna help us take him.
L5322 +++$+++ u66 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CASEY +++$+++ Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
L5321 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
L5318 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
L5317 +++$+++ u66 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CASEY +++$+++ Would you guys...
L5316 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I hear you've got visitors.
L4960 +++$+++ u66 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CASEY +++$+++ I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
L4959 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ How about it?
L4945 +++$+++ u66 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CASEY +++$+++ Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
L4944 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
L5348 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
L5347 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You're done.  End of story.
L5346 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
L5340 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
L5339 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I don't think you're gonna make it.
L5338 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
L4629 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
L4628 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You lying son of a bitch...
L5384 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
L5383 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Thanks.
L5382 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
L5381 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
L5380 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
L5379 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
L5378 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
L5377 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
L5376 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ There's nothin' to talk about.
L5375 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
L5373 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
L5372 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
L5353 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
L5352 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
L5351 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You okay?
L5314 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
L5313 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Partnership?
L5312 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
L5311 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
L5310 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
L5309 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Whatever play I maker just back me up.
L5308 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Hey, there she is...
L5307 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
L5306 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
L5305 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
L5304 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Do I get to kiss her too?
L5291 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
L5290 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
L5257 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Don't worry about it.
L5256 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ It's late, they're closing...
L5255 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
L5254 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
L5253 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
L5252 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
L5251 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
L5250 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
L5249 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Hey, how'd my car get here?
L5237 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
L5236 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Notice something funny about that bus?
L5227 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Luther's on the move...
L5226 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Why?
L5225 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
L5224 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ That was quick.
L5213 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
L5212 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, I see her.
L5210 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah. Guess not.
L5209 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
L5208 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
L5207 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You sure that's the reason?
L5206 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
L5205 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
L5204 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
L5202 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ So you took the rest of the night off...
L5201 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
L5200 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
L5199 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
L5198 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
L5197 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ We missed.
L5196 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What about Ganz?
L5195 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What about Luther?
L5192 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hello. And goodbye.
L5191 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
L5190 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Where's luther?
L5172 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
L5171 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
L5085 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ No way...
L5084 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You stay with me...
L5083 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
L5077 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
L5076 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ That was in style a couple years back, man.
L5074 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
L5073 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
L5072 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
L5071 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ No class...
L5070 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
L5069 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
L5068 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
L5067 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
L5066 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
L5065 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
L5064 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
L5063 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
L5062 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Doesn't it get... Tiring?
L5061 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ If they don't tell me what I need to know...
L5060 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
L5059 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
L5058 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
L5057 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
L5056 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
L5055 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
L5054 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
L5053 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
L5052 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
L5051 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
L5050 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
L5049 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
L5038 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
L5037 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Musta got some primo bondsman.
L5036 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What?
L5035 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
L5034 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
L5033 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
L5030 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Shit.
L5029 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
L5028 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
L5025 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You just drove by it.
L5024 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ ...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
L5023 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
L5022 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
L5021 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Where's the goddamn car?
L5020 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah.  Right.
L5019 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
L5018 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Right, partner.
L5017 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
L5016 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Where's the money?
L5014 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
L5013 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You gonna let me keep any of it?
L5012 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Not likely, convict.
L5011 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ We split 50-50?
L5010 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
L5009 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ He's after your money.
L5008 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
L5007 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Just tell me about the money.
L5005 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Jesus.
L5004 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Half a million.

L5002 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I been waiting a long time for some money.
L4997 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
L4996 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ They saved your ass, convict.
L4995 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
L4994 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
L4975 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
L4974 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
L4973 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
L4972 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
L4971 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
L4970 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
L4969 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
L4965 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
L4964 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Let's go.
L4939 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Come on.

L4930 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
L4929 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You made that move, huh?
L4912 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
L4911 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
L4896 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
L4895 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
L4894 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
L4893 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
L4891 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ The bet's off.
L4890 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
L4889 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
L4888 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What are you talkin' about?
L4887 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
L4886 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ That's never been one of my problems.
L4885 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
L4884 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
L4883 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
L4882 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Hey, you wanna bet?
L4881 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You need five years training to handle a joint like...
L4880 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
L4879 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
L4878 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
L4877 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
L4876 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
L4875 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
L4874 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
L4873 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Well?
L4871 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
L4870 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
L4869 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You have a good time?
L4868 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Last night.

L4864 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
L4863 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Now, where we goin', convict?
L4861 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
L4860 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
L4858 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
L4857 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
L4855 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
L4854 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
L4853 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
L4852 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ We eat when I say we eat.
L4851 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
L4850 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
L4849 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
L4848 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
L4828 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
L4827 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
L4826 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I think you better put him on ice, man.
L4825 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What do you think?
L4816 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Want to try it again?
L4815 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Thank you.
L4814 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hey, this works pretty good.
L4803 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
L4802 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
L4801 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
L4800 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
L4792 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'm helpin' you, huh?
L4791 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
L4790 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
L4789 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
L4788 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I may call you worse than that.
L4787 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
L4786 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
L4785 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
L4784 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
L4783 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
L4782 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Luther was part of the gang?
L4781 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
L4780 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
L4779 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
L4778 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah.
L4775 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Shit.  I'm already sorry.
L4774 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
L4773 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ No way to start a partnership.
L4772 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
L4771 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
L4770 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
L4769 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
L4766 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
L4765 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
L4764 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
L4763 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ This prison gives out $400 suits?
L4751 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'll think about it.
L4750 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
L4749 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Bullshit.
L4748 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I got a lot to protect.
L4747 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
L4746 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
L4745 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You're crazy.
L4744 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
L4743 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah?
L4741 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
L4740 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
L4739 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, I noticed...
L4732 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
L4731 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You here to write my life story?
L4729 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Sure, anything you want.
L4728 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
L4727 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You got a name, cop?
L5245 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
L5244 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Where the Christ do you think you're going?
L5243 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
L5242 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
L5104 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
L5103 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I didn't have the time.
L5102 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
L5101 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
L5100 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ What a screw-up.
L5099 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ You couldn't get to him?
L5098 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
L5097 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Which one pulled the trigger?
L5096 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
L5095 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ How did they get away?
L5094 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I lost them, that's what happened.
L5093 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ What the bell happened?
L4703 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'll keep it in mind.
L4702 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
L4701 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah?
L4700 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Jack?
L4699 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
L4698 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
L4697 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
L4696 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
L4695 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
L4694 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
L4693 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah...
L4692 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
L4691 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
L4690 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Yeah, I read the report...
L4689 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
L4644 +++$+++ u77 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ YOUNG COP +++$+++ I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
L4643 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
L4642 +++$+++ u77 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ YOUNG COP +++$+++ Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
L4639 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
L4638 +++$+++ u77 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ YOUNG COP +++$+++ But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...

L5144 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I got to wait for a call.
L5143 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ I'm heading out. How about you?
L5142 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Bullshit red tape.
L5138 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ Nothing.
L5137 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
L5136 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ Doesn't look like it.
L5135 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
L5134 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
L5133 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ So do you...been a long day.

L4682 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ Hey ... Dick Tracy.
L4681 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Tell me that's not the same guy.

L4679 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
L4678 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
L4677 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Who are all these?
L4676 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
L4675 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Billy Bear...
L4673 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Shit.
L4672 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
L4671 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'll help you out.
L4670 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.

L4822 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ When? How?
L4821 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
L4819 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ I don't know.
L4818 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
L4817 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
L4813 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Who gives a fuck what you think?
L4812 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
L4811 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
L4810 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
L4809 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ A cop...
L5365 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ That's what I always say.
L5364 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You're impossible...
L5363 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
L5362 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Tell me.
L5361 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
L5360 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Where is he?
L5359 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Three more hours...
L5358 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
L5357 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
L5356 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
L5355 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ How'd they take it back at headquarters?
L5303 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Let's go, Reggie.
L5302 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
L5301 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Whaddya think?
L5298 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
L5297 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
L5296 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
L5295 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ So what?
L5294 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
L5293 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
L5292 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
L5287 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
L5286 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ How do you know?
L5285 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
L5284 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
L5276 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
L5275 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You real down?
L5263 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
L5262 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
L5261 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Don't.  We've had a hard night.
L5260 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
L5259 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hiya, kid.
L5258 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Hey, I don't believe it.
L5221 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Fuck you.
L5220 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hi, it's me...
L5219 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Hello.
L5169 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Just a second, that's all!
L5168 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Jack, wait...
L5167 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
L5165 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Jack?  What was that?
L5164 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
L5153 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ So am I.
L5152 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
L5151 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No wonder you're so popular.
L5150 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
L5149 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
L4840 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
L4839 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
L4837 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
L4836 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
L4718 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
L4717 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
L4716 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
L4715 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
L4714 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
L4713 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
L4712 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
L4709 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
L4708 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Jack, are you okay?
L4707 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
L4706 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You made the front page.
L4705 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, one of my favorites.
L4704 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Great place for lunch.
L4535 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Guess people ought to know who I am...
L4534 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
L4533 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Thanks for the coffee.
L4532 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
L4531 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You sure you want me to?
L4530 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Call me later.
L4529 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ That's the way I see it, too.
L4528 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
L4525 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
L4524 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
L4523 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
L4522 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
L4521 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
L4520 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
L4519 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
L4517 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
L4516 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Maybe you ought to buy me one.
L4514 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
L4513 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
L4488 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
L4487 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
L4486 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hey, you know what I really think?
L4485 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
L4484 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
L4483 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
L4482 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
L4481 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
L4480 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I guess he got the message...
L4479 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
L4478 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What'd you do?
L4477 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
L4476 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What's wrong with that?
L4475 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'm all wet.
L4474 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ That's the way I see it, too.
L4473 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You're hopeless.
L4472 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hey, you're right.
L4471 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I still don't think it's loaded.
L4470 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
L4469 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I don't think your gun's loaded...
L4468 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
L4467 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What am I wanted for?
L5289 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
L5288 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
L5282 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ That's no bull.
L5281 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Hey, two days with him is enough.
L5280 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ How would you know?
L5279 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Hard man to live with.
L5268 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Shrink major, not a shrink.
L5267 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
L5266 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
L5265 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
L5264 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Who the hell are you?
L4613 +++$+++ u74 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
L4612 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ Keep stallin'.
L4610 +++$+++ u74 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What do you want?
L4609 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ Stall.
L4604 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ Shut up.
L4603 +++$+++ u74 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What do you want?  What's goin' on?
L4602 +++$+++ u74 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
L4601 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ Shut up.
L4600 +++$+++ u74 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Hey...
L4500 +++$+++ u72 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Sure, right.
L4499 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
L4498 +++$+++ u72 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yeah, old times.
L4497 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ We got a lot to talk about.
L4496 +++$+++ u72 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Can't complain.
L4495 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ How ya doin'?
L4494 +++$+++ u72 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
L4493 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ How hot are they?
L5234 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
L5233 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Rosalie, you okay?
L5231 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ First, the money.
L5230 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Let her go.
L4559 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
L4558 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Come on, you can trust me. Please.
L4555 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
L4554 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ You chickenshit punk...
L4553 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
L4552 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ When?
L4551 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
L4550 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ Billy, go ahead, break it...
L4549 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Don't give me this, we were partners.
L4548 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
L4547 +++$+++ u69 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ GANZ +++$+++ You want that Indian to snap her neck?
L4546 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ I don't know what you're talkin' about.

L5121 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
L5120 +++$+++ u76 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ SOSNA +++$+++ This ain't a credit business.

L5890 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
L5889 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
L5876 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
L5875 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
L5693 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ You know exactly where they are!
L5692 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
L5680 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ The case was stolen?
L5679 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
L5678 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ The case..with the stones... Where is it?
L5674 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Napoleon... small.
L5673 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ What're you laughing about?
L5645 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ At your service.
L5644 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Corn-i-Lius?
L5643 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
L5761 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ I know...
L5760 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ You are a monster, Zorg!
L5756 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
L5755 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
L5754 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
L5752 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ They are robots!
L5751 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ ...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
L5748 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
L5747 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ No thank you.
L5746 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ ...would you like a drink?
L5745 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
L5744 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ ...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
L5743 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Why?  What's wrong with me?
L5742 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
L5741 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
L5740 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ ...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
L5739 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
L5738 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
L5737 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
L5711 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ I'm fucked!
L5710 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ ...We're saved!
L6266 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ That's what I'm saying.
L6265 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
L6264 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
L6263 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
L6259 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
L6258 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
L6172 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
L6171 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ When is she not in trouble?
L6170 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Leeloo's in trouble?
L6169 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
L6168 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
L5840 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
L5839 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ What are you doing?
L5833 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
L5832 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Of course.
L5831 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Good luck..
L5830 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ We have to save the world.
L5829 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ What kind of mission?
L5828 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
L5827 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
L5826 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
L5658 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ That's what I thought.
L5657 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ It means, "Never without my permission".
L5656 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
L5655 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I know. I was there when she arrived.
L5654 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
L5653 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
L5652 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
L5651 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Dallas. Korben Dallas.
L5650 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
L5649 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ She's an exception..
L5648 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ They all like this in your family, father?
L5628 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
L5627 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ So you do know her.
L5626 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
L5625 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ You noticed...
L5624 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ He's a she!
L5622 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ The girl?
L5621 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I brought the girl remember?
L5620 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Who are you?
L5617 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ She dropped in on me... holding this.
L5616 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
L5615 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
L5614 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
L5613 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
L5557 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
L5556 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ What are we going to do?
L5522 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. President.
L5521 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
L5516 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
L5515 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
L5512 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Yes..thank God..
L5511 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Is there anything that can stop it?
L5510 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
L5509 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ And then?
L5508 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
L5470 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
L5469 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
L5468 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
L5464 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ One more reason to shoot first eh?
L5463 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
L6252 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
L6251 +++$+++ u79 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
L5913 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
L5912 +++$+++ u79 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
L5911 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Where's Leeloo?
L5731 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
L5730 +++$+++ u79 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
L5689 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Perfect.
L5688 +++$+++ u79 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ They really made her...
L5687 +++$+++ u79 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I didn't know your size.
L5686 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
L5676 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Yes. Of course..
L5675 +++$+++ u79 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
L5672 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
L5671 +++$+++ u79 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What's she doing?
L5647 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
L5646 +++$+++ u79 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
L5637 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
L5636 +++$+++ u79 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Father, will you please explain what's going on?
L5632 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
L5631 +++$+++ u79 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What is?
L5630 +++$+++ u78 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ It's a miracle!!!
L6124 +++$+++ u80 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DIVA +++$+++ They are... with me...
L6123 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
L6120 +++$+++ u80 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DIVA +++$+++ I would like to have died in peace...
L6119 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
L6118 +++$+++ u80 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DIVA +++$+++ I don't have time... I need to know.
L6117 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
L6116 +++$+++ u80 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DIVA +++$+++ Do you love her?
L6115 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
L6114 +++$+++ u80 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DIVA +++$+++ She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
L6110 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ ...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
L6109 +++$+++ u80 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DIVA +++$+++ Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
L6108 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Leeloo... is... she's...
L6107 +++$+++ u80 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DIVA +++$+++ The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
L6106 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Who?
L6105 +++$+++ u80 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ DIVA +++$+++ You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
L5670 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Leeloo..

L5881 +++$+++ u88 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Have you pulled yourself together?
L5880 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Yeah?
L5792 +++$+++ u88 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
L5791 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
L5790 +++$+++ u88 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
L5789 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
L5788 +++$+++ u88 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
L5787 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
L5786 +++$+++ u88 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ ...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
L5785 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Other than that... You all right?
L5783 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Yes ma..
L5782 +++$+++ u88 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
L5780 +++$+++ u88 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
L5779 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Hi Ma...
L5778 +++$+++ u88 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
L5777 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ ...Hello?
L6212 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Found it?
L6211 +++$+++ u98 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ 6... 5...
L6209 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
L6208 +++$+++ u98 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ 30 seconds...
L5835 +++$+++ u98 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ This is a police control action..
L5834 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I'm sorry..
L5548 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Thanks for reminding me..
L5547 +++$+++ u98 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ You have nine points left on your license..
L5546 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
L5545 +++$+++ u98 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
L5544 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
L5543 +++$+++ u98 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
L6283 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
L6282 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Is that all?
L6280 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
L6279 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
L6278 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ What did you say? What did you do?
L6216 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
L6215 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Solid little jobs, aren't they?
L6214 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Fuck it! Hold tight!
L6213 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ I don't even know what I'm looking for!
L6207 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ It's like a cab isn't it?
L6206 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ You know how to fly this thing?
L6191 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I'll be right back.
L6190 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
L6184 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Not without Leeloo.
L6183 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
L6158 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
L6157 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ He's on vacation.
L6156 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Six to the left. One to the right.
L6133 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ Got it...
L6132 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
L6026 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
L6025 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Yeah, very big, a giant.
L6024 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ ...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
L6023 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I don't think this is a good time...
L6022 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
L6021 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
L6020 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
L5934 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ Crystal.
L5933 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
L5925 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Uh... not really.
L5924 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ ...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
L5923 +++$+++ u86 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LOC RHOD +++$+++ Does it get any better or what!
L5922 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ ...Hi.
L5822 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Oh, yes you will...
L5821 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Three of us will never fit in there!
L5820 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ ...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
L5819 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
L5818 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ I thought you were divorced.
L5817 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ It's my wife.
L5816 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ What is it?
L5815 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ ...Shit!
L5813 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
L5812 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Why not?
L5811 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I'm not going.
L5810 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
L5809 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
L5806 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
L5805 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I've had enough good news for today
L5804 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Don't you open your messages?
L5803 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ You're the only one left alive...
L5802 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ And the third one?
L5801 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
L5800 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
L5799 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Just one... why me?
L5798 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
L5797 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Where have I heard this song before?
L5796 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ To save the world.
L5795 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ What mission?
L5794 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
L6309 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I love you...
L6308 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Tell me...
L6305 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Because...
L6304 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Why?... Why would you need me?
L6303 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
L6302 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
L6301 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
L6300 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Exactly.
L6299 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ ...Like love...
L6298 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
L6297 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
L6293 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
L6292 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ I want to sleep... forever...
L6291 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
L6290 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ I'm so tired...
L6289 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ It's up to you now, Angel!
L6270 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ ...The rain falls...
L6269 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
L6268 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ The wind blows... the fire burns...
L6267 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
L6241 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Protect life... Until death.
L6240 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I told you not to read all that crap!
L6239 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
L6238 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
L6237 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ I'm so very sad.
L6067 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
L6066 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ You're nothing but a... a...
L6064 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ It's difficult.
L6063 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ And you can't concentrate with me around?.
L6062 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
L6059 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
L6058 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
L6057 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Where you going?
L6056 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ OK, you can turn around!
L6055 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ You noticed..
L6054 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
L6053 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ You get that off the screen?
L6052 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ You know women normally change five times more than men.
L6051 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Here we go again...
L5965 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ ...Hoppi-hoppa.
L5964 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Uh...
L5963 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
L5962 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Apipoussan?
L5961 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Apipoussan!
L5960 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
L5959 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
L5958 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
L5957 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ All 900.
L5956 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Which one?
L5955 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Learning language.
L5954 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Finished what?
L5950 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ What is... Make Love?
L5949 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
L5947 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
L5946 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Love...
L5944 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
L5943 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Apipoulai!
L5901 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
L5900 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Dinoine chagantakat!
L5871 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Oh god!
L5870 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Cornelius..
L5869 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ You hear that?
L5859 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Uh..you're welcome.
L5858 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
L5825 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I suppose that means "Hi" ?
L5824 +++$+++ u85 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ LEELOO +++$+++ Apipoulai!
L5729 +++$+++ u97 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ THAI +++$+++ Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
L5728 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ At least I won lunch.
L5726 +++$+++ u97 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ THAI +++$+++ You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
L5725 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
L5724 +++$+++ u97 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ THAI +++$+++ How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
L5723 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
L5722 +++$+++ u97 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ THAI +++$+++ Not going to open?
L5540 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ You're welcome..
L5539 +++$+++ u89 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ Thanks..
L5538 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ You gotta push the little yellow button...
L5537 +++$+++ u89 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ It's not?
L5536 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
L5535 +++$+++ u89 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ Uh..
L5534 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
L5533 +++$+++ u89 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
L5532 +++$+++ u84 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ KORBEN +++$+++ Been here long?
L5531 +++$+++ u89 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUGGER +++$+++ The cash man!
L6314 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
L6313 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
L5586 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ An elephant couldn't crack it.
L5585 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ This thing solid?
L5574 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Wonderful!
L5573 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ ...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
L5570 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
L5569 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
L5568 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
L5567 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
L5566 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
L5565 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
L5564 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Talk English Doc.
L5563 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
L5562 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Have you identified it?
L5561 +++$+++ u87 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MACTILBURGH +++$+++ Actually only one cell survived..
L5560 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ This is all that survived?
L6255 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ How much time is left?
L6254 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ They just landed in the desert.
L5774 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
L5773 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ I want your best man on this!
L5770 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ...What do you mean?
L5769 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
L5768 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
L5767 +++$+++ u90 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ MUNRO +++$+++ I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
L5480 +++$+++ u96 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ STAEDERT +++$+++ I'm about to, Mr. President.
L5479 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
L5453 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Gentlemen?
L5452 +++$+++ u96 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ STAEDERT +++$+++ My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
L5451 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Recommendations.
L5450 +++$+++ u96 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ STAEDERT +++$+++ Wait or act.
L5449 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Options.
L5448 +++$+++ u96 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ STAEDERT +++$+++ Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
L5447 +++$+++ u91 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.

L6225 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ I'm not at the hotel!
L6224 +++$+++ u94 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
L6223 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
L6222 +++$+++ u94 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Yes, Sir!
L6221 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
L6220 +++$+++ u94 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
L6219 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ How's that? Can you hear me better now?
L6012 +++$+++ u95 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ ...I can't wait to be among you.
L6011 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
L6009 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
L6008 +++$+++ u95 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ How's our deal coming along?
L6007 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Got it.
L6006 +++$+++ u95 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
L6005 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
L6004 +++$+++ u95 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ ...Not far, now.
L6003 +++$+++ u99 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ ZORG +++$+++ No... not at all.  Where are you?
L6002 +++$+++ u95 +++$+++ m5 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Am I disturbing you?
L7002 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I just talked to her.
L7001 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
L7000 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Tom... she's dead.
L6999 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
L6998 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What?
L6997 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mrs. Christian.
L6996 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Who are you calling?
L6993 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Amy...
L6992 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
L6991 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Don't...
L6990 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You're killing me...
L6989 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I don't know what to say
L6988 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
L6987 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
L6986 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You should have.
L6985 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
L6984 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
L6983 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You don't understand...
L6982 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You couldn't?
L6981 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
L6980 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
L6979 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
L6978 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I don't know.  I'm sorry...
L6977 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
L6976 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
L6975 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Tom...
L6974 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
L6973 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
L6972 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
L6971 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What happened to you?
L6964 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Just do it, Amy, please, go.
L6963 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ ... What's going on?
L6962 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
L6961 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What's wrong?  Are you alright?
L6960 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
L6959 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Tom?  Where have you been... ?
L6958 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
L6957 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Hello?
L6435 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
L6434 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Why the gun?
L6433 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
L6432 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I know.
L6431 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
L6430 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I understand.
L6429 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
L6365 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
L6364 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
L6363 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
L6362 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Sure.  I'll call the guy.
L6361 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
L6352 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I love you.
L6351 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I love you.
L6350 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Honey, I'm not, please...
L6349 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
L6348 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
L6347 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ How's the detective business?
L6344 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
L6343 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Okay, I believe you.
L6342 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
L6341 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I'm not accusing you...
L6340 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
L6339 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Your clothing reeks of it.
L6338 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
L6337 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What's this... have you been smoking... ?
L6336 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Do you know how much I missed you?
L6335 +++$+++ u100 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Welcome home.
L6612 +++$+++ u101 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ ANGRY DEALER +++$+++ There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
L6611 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
L6610 +++$+++ u101 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ ANGRY DEALER +++$+++ What you see is what I got, mister.
L6609 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Snuff?
L6608 +++$+++ u101 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ ANGRY DEALER +++$+++ There's nothing harder.
L6607 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Anything harder?
L6606 +++$+++ u101 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ ANGRY DEALER +++$+++ Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
L6605 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What are these?
L6910 +++$+++ u102 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO +++$+++ I promised him to Machine.
L6909 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What the fuck... !
L6717 +++$+++ u102 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO +++$+++ Nobody knows anything.
L6716 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Dino...
L6715 +++$+++ u102 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO +++$+++ There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
L6714 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
L6713 +++$+++ u102 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO +++$+++ Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
L6712 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm telling you...
L6711 +++$+++ u102 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO +++$+++ Bullshit.
L6710 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
L6709 +++$+++ u102 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L6708 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
L6707 +++$+++ u102 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO +++$+++ What do you want?
L6864 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
L6863 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
L6862 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Bring the film, or we kill him.
L6861 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
L6860 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
L6859 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
L6858 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Friend of yours?
L6853 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I remember him.
L6852 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
L6846 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
L6845 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Look, I don't know what this...
L6844 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
L6842 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Take out your gun!
L6841 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What are you... ?
L6840 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
L6835 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Sure.
L6834 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
L6833 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What are these for?
L6832 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ They should be here any minute.
L6831 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Where are the women?
L6830 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Excellent.
L6829 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Right here.
L6828 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ You brought the money?
L6815 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
L6814 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Where's that?
L6812 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
L6811 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Machine's in?
L6810 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
L6808 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
L6807 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
L6806 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm camera shy.
L6805 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ What's the problem?
L6804 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'd rather you didn't.
L6803 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
L6802 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
L6801 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ We can do that.
L6800 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
L6799 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ If it's not him, there's no deal.
L6798 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Machine.
L6797 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
L6796 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ I'll consider it.
L6795 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I want to watch you work.
L6794 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ And they are?
L6793 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
L6792 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Is it?
L6791 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That's five thousand dollars.
L6790 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
L6789 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ You said something about money.
L6784 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Hmm.
L6783 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ A fellow investor.
L6782 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
L6781 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
L6780 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ What can I do for you today?
L6779 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
L6936 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ You betrayed us.
L6935 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
L6912 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
L6911 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ ... sorry...
L6908 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Fuck off.
L6907 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Leave him alone.
L6906 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You're a dead man.
L6866 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Move it, dirtbag... !
L6865 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
L6848 +++$+++ u103 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DINO VELVET +++$+++ Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
L6847 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Is that him?
L6464 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ It's good what you're doing.
L6463 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
L6462 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
L6461 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Any good?
L6460 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
L6454 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
L6453 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
L6452 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
L6451 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
L6450 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ I'm not so sure about this.
L6449 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
L6448 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ Why don't they come to me?
L6447 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
L6446 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ We do.
L6445 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I figured you share information.
L6444 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
L6443 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
L6442 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
L6441 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ There are reasons for the way we do things here.
L6440 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
L6439 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ Alright, Tom.
L6438 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Call me Tom.
L6437 +++$+++ u104 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
L7076 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
L7075 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
L7074 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I never killed anyone.
L7073 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Easy enough for you.
L7072 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
L7071 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Don't think I won't.
L7070 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Do it.
L7067 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
L7066 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Where?  Show me where.
L7065 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
L7064 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Show me where you buried her.
L7063 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You got absolute zero.
L7062 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Stop talking.
L7061 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
L7060 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
L7059 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Keep moving.
L7057 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Show me.
L7056 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
L7055 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What did you do with her body?
L7054 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
L7053 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Nobody saw you bring her in?
L7052 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
L7051 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Tell me what happened.
L7050 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
L7049 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You enjoy it?
L7048 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
L7045 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Because we're going there.
L7044 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Why?
L7043 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
L7039 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
L7038 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
L7037 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What the fuck do you want from me?
L7036 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
L7035 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Something like that.
L7034 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
L7033 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ It was a lot of fucking money.
L7032 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
L7031 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
L7030 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ How much did he pay you?
L7029 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L7028 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Told him you could get him a snuff film.
L7027 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
L7026 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
L7025 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
L7024 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
L7023 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I told you, I don't know.
L7022 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I want his name.
L7021 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't know...
L7020 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Who is Machine?
L7019 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What do you want?
L7018 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Starting to recognize a pattern?
L7017 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Fuck you!
L7016 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Don't ask questions.
L7015 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How'd you find me here?
L7014 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Don't bore me with that bullshit.
L7013 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm gonna kill you.
L6920 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
L6919 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What's he talking about?
L6702 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
L6701 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What the fuck are you.. ?
L6700 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
L6699 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Who is this.
L6698 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I know what you did.
L6697 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What?
L6696 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I know what you did.
L6695 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, who's this?
L6694 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Eddie.
L6693 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Celebrity Films.
L6692 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Fuck you!
L6691 +++$+++ u107 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
L6690 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Look, you cocksucker...
L6689 +++$+++ u107 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
L6688 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
L6687 +++$+++ u107 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MALE VOICE +++$+++ I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
L6686 +++$+++ u105 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
L6922 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
L6921 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ He's lying.
L6903 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
L6902 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Give me the film.
L6901 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You'll get it when we get there.
L6900 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Give me the film.
L6899 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Fuck you.
L6898 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ You almost went over your limit.
L6894 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
L6893 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Enlighten me.
L6892 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Isn't it incredibly obvious?
L6891 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
L6890 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
L6889 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm asking.
L6888 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ You're asking me why?
L6887 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
L6886 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ You're making me very angry.
L6885 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
L6884 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Shut your mouth and drive!
L6883 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
L6882 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Shut up.
L6881 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
L6880 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
L6879 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
L6878 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
L6877 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ They're no friends of mine.
L6876 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
L6875 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Never mind how I found you.
L6874 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
L6873 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ I was well compensated.
L6872 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
L6871 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
L6870 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
L6869 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
L6868 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
L6380 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
L6379 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That's right.
L6378 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ You are a private investigator?
L6377 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Of what sort?
L6376 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
L6375 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm listening.
L6374 +++$+++ u106 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ LONGDALE +++$+++ Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
L6824 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
L6823 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Look... that's awful generous and everything...
L6822 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
L6821 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What's this?
L6819 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Nope.
L6818 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
L6817 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
L6816 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What's next?
L6788 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ "Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
L6787 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
L6769 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
L6768 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You don't need to be here.
L6765 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
L6764 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Who is he, his name?
L6763 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
L6762 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Who is he?
L6758 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
L6757 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Wha... ?
L6754 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
L6753 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
L6752 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Great.
L6751 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's their Presidential Suite.
L6750 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
L6737 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ See ya.
L6736 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
L6735 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You want me to come out there and play private eye?
L6734 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
L6733 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm a working stiff, pops.
L6732 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
L6731 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
L6730 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Alright, I get the picture.
L6729 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
L6728 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
L6727 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Where does he sell it?
L6726 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're learning.
L6725 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Specialty product.
L6724 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
L6723 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
L6722 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
L6637 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Good question.
L6636 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
L6635 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ A daughter.
L6634 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
L6633 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What about me?
L6632 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
L6631 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
L6630 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
L6629 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
L6628 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
L6627 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
L6626 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't know, where are yours?
L6625 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Where are your parents?
L6624 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Twenty-five.
L6623 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ How old are you?
L6622 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
L6621 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
L6620 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
L6619 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Snuff films.
L6618 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
L6617 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Child pornography.
L6616 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
L6615 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Interesting theory.
L6614 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
L6598 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
L6597 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ ... Hello... ?
L6596 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
L6595 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
L6594 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
L6593 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sounds good, pops.
L6592 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
L6591 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Four hundred a week, off the books.
L6590 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ How much do you make now?
L6589 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How much?
L6588 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
L6587 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
L6586 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Not quite.
L6585 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
L6584 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm not a cop.
L6583 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
L6582 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
L6581 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There's not much illegal.
L6580 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
L6579 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Max.
L6578 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
L6577 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Three, four years.
L6576 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ How long you been working there?
L6575 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Good for you.
L6574 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
L6571 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
L6570 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
L6569 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
L6568 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Remember me?
L6561 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
L6560 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
L6559 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
L6558 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Truman Capote.
L6557 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
L6556 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
L6553 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'll risk it.
L6552 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
L6551 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
L6550 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
L6549 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Pardon me?
L6548 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
L6547 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Yeah... guess so.
L6546 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Big date tonight?
L6749 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
L6748 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ How will I get it to you?
L6747 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
L6746 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Fine...
L6745 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
L6744 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
L6743 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I hope it's nothing serious.
L6742 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
L6741 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
L6740 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ How are you?  Having any luck?
L6739 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
L6738 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Hello?
L6655 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
L6654 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ You told me to look, so I looked.
L6653 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
L6652 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Okay.
L6651 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
L6650 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Do you think the film could have cost that much?
L6649 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm here.
L6648 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Hello... ?
L6647 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
L6646 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You're joking.
L6645 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
L6644 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Okay, I follow you so far...
L6643 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
L6642 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ The checks were for odd amounts...
L6641 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm not positive this means anything.
L6640 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
L6639 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Okay...
L6428 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
L6427 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Nothing remotely like this.
L6426 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ You've found missing persons before.
L6425 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
L6424 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
L6423 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It won't work like that.
L6422 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
L6421 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You don't have any other choice.
L6420 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I told you I can't, not yet.
L6419 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You... you need to go to the police.
L6418 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
L6417 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Will you watch it and see for yourself?
L6416 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
L6415 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I'm telling you it's not that.
L6414 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
L6413 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ No.
L6412 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
L6411 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
L6410 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
L6409 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
L6408 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm afraid I don't...
L6407 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
L6406 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Cash, stock certificates, and this...
L6405 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Do you want to tell me what you found?
L6404 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
L6403 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
L6402 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
L6401 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Just curious.
L6400 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
L6399 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
L6398 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
L6397 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ He succeeded.
L6396 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
L6395 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Pittsburgh?
L6392 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'll do whatever I can to help.
L6391 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
L6390 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ My condolences.
L6389 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
L6388 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
L6387 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
L6386 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
L6385 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
L6384 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ He's odd.
L6383 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Thank you.
L6382 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
L6373 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
L6372 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Uh huh, pleasure.
L6369 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I try to be.
L6368 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
L7098 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...
L7097 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
L7096 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
L7095 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No... no... no...
L7094 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
L7093 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No...
L7092 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
L7091 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Who are you?
L7090 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
L7089 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Who is this... ?
L7088 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
L7087 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ What... ?
L7086 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
L7085 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ What are you talking about... ?
L7084 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
L7083 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I remember.  You just left...
L7082 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
L7081 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Hello... ?
L6536 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
L6535 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's been six years.
L6534 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
L6532 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Yes.
L6531 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
L6528 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
L6527 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
L6526 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Will you let me look?
L6525 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ How... how can you say that to me...?
L6524 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
L6523 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
L6522 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
L6521 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I don't know.  I think so.
L6520 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Do you think the police did a good job?
L6519 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ There wasn't one.  The police looked.
L6518 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
L6517 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ What?
L6516 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
L6515 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ You should be.
L6514 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ No.
L6513 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Are you religious?
L6512 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ We're all like that.
L6511 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
L6508 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Okay.
L6507 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
L6504 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Of course.
L6503 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
L6502 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
L6501 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I had to ask.  I apologize.
L6500 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
L6499 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I didn't mean to...
L6498 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
L6497 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
L6496 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ It got to be too much for him.
L6495 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Why do you think he did it?
L6494 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
L6493 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
L6492 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Yes.
L6491 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
L6490 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I don't know.
L6489 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What was she running from?
L6488 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
L6487 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ She just seemed... depressed... ?
L6486 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No.
L6485 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
L6483 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
L6482 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
L6481 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That's exactly what I am.
L6480 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
L6479 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
L6477 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
L6476 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No.
L6475 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
L6474 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Neil... Neil Cole.
L6473 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
L6472 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
L6471 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Yes, but...
L6470 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
L6469 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I don't understand, who are... ?
L6468 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
L6467 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
L6466 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Yes... ?
L6671 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'll do what I can.
L6670 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
L6669 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
L6668 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
L6667 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Her belongings?
L6666 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Those are her belongings.
L6665 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What is this?
L6662 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
L6661 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Do you know what happened to her?
L6659 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Yes.  I remember her.
L6658 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
L6657 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Yes... I remember Mary
L6360 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
L6359 +++$+++ u112 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ POLITICIAN +++$+++ Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
L6358 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
L6357 +++$+++ u112 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ POLITICIAN +++$+++ He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
L6356 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ No, sir, he is not.
L6355 +++$+++ u112 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ POLITICIAN +++$+++ None too discreet, is he?
L6354 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
L6684 +++$+++ u113 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ SALESPERSON +++$+++ Certainly, sir.
L6683 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
L6682 +++$+++ u113 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ SALESPERSON +++$+++ I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
L6681 +++$+++ u113 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ SALESPERSON +++$+++ Okay.  Fine.
L6680 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ No, you may not.
L6679 +++$+++ u113 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ SALESPERSON +++$+++ Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
L6678 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Cash.
L6677 +++$+++ u113 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ SALESPERSON +++$+++ Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
L6676 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Okay, I'll take it all.
L8208 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Then we'll stay up together.
L8207 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
L8206 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ We'll figure it out.
L8204 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
L8203 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I can't go back to sleep again.
L8202 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yeah, or turn you into toast.
L8201 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
L8200 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
L8199 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I can't find him.
L8198 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
L8197 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It was bad.
L8196 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
L8156 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Kristen...
L8155 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You alright?
L8097 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What?
L8096 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Kincaid and Joey died last night.
L8095 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What's wrong?
L8094 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Alice, you think you can leave?
L8037 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
L8036 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Rick...I can't.
L8035 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
L8034 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
L8033 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
L8032 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don't want to.
L8031 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
L8030 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What?
L8029 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
L8101 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
L8100 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Kristen, what happened?
L8063 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
L8062 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You what?
L8060 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
L8059 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ How'd you learn so much about dreams?
L8058 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
L8057 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
L8056 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
L8055 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Sounds like a game show host to me.
L8054 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
L8053 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ You could do worse.
L8052 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
L8051 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Yeah, I'm not so sure.
L8050 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I'm sure they're around.
L8049 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
L8048 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
L8179 +++$+++ u122 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
L8178 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Then you saw him, too?
L8177 +++$+++ u122 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ That obvious, huh?
L8176 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You've been up all night?
L8175 +++$+++ u122 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ What?
L8174 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ We have matching luggage.
L8173 +++$+++ u122 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
L8087 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know.
L8086 +++$+++ u122 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
L8085 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
L8084 +++$+++ u122 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
L8083 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You in a hurry?
L8324 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Save it for later.  Come on!
L8323 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ You look great!
L8295 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
L8294 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ What the hell was that?
L8290 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
L8289 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Here we are.
L8288 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
L8287 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
L8278 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It's okay, we're just about there.
L8277 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
L8276 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
L8275 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You just feel sorry for me.
L8274 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
L8273 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
L8255 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Who?
L8254 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
L8253 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Then what else can we do?
L8252 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
L8251 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
L8250 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
L8248 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
L8247 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Is there something we can do?
L8246 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Not really.
L8218 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
L8217 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
L8216 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Three days.
L8215 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ How long have you been awake?
L8214 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
L8213 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
L8212 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
L8211 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Extra money, huh?
L8210 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I've been working double shifts.
L8190 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Kristen's story really got to her.
L8189 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
L8166 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ "In her dream"?
L8165 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
L8162 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
L8161 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
L8080 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know.  Uh...Alice.
L8079 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
L8078 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
L8077 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ You're his sister, right?
L8076 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No...
L8187 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
L8186 +++$+++ u117 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Enough of that crap.
L8185 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It was Freddy.
L8184 +++$+++ u117 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
L8092 +++$+++ u117 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
L8091 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
L7996 +++$+++ u117 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Alright, I think I see salvation...
L7995 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Rick, please.
L8229 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
L8228 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ About Freddy?
L8227 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
L8226 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
L8225 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Been up with Alice.
L8159 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ She knew she was gonna die.
L8158 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Hey man, we're all sorry...
L8126 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
L8125 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Nice neighborhood.
L8124 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
L8123 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ So?
L8122 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
L8121 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ So what's up?  What'd I miss?
L8120 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Let me talk to you.
L8119 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ I don't get it.
L8099 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
L8098 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Hey, Rick!
L7994 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Earth to Alice...
L7993 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ T-T-Thanks Alice...
L8143 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
L8142 +++$+++ u118 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Honey, we went over this in therapy.
L8141 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
L8140 +++$+++ u118 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'm sorry honey, but...
L8138 +++$+++ u118 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Your distraught.  It'll help...
L8137 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ What's wrong with me?
L8136 +++$+++ u118 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
L8135 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
L8134 +++$+++ u118 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Something the matter with the cuisine?
L8118 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
L8117 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
L8116 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
L8115 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'll tell you later.
L8106 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
L8105 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I though Freddy was just an old town story.
L8104 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
L8065 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Oh God!  He killed them!
L8064 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What is it?
L7984 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
L7983 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ What?
L7982 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Avoid-all-contact-day.
L7981 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Something wrong with the stairs?
L8072 +++$+++ u120 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Don't worry, honey
L8071 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ You don't get it, he's after me...
L8070 +++$+++ u120 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ You just stay put.  You need rest.
L8069 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ I gotta get out of here.
L8068 +++$+++ u120 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ You had a nasty bump.
L8067 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
L8066 +++$+++ u120 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Feeling better now?
L8729 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You're not taking my baby!
L8728 +++$+++ u129 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MRS. JORDAN +++$+++ We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
L8725 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
L8724 +++$+++ u129 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MRS. JORDAN +++$+++ In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
L8722 +++$+++ u129 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MRS. JORDAN +++$+++ And ours.  It's our grandchild.
L8721 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
L8718 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
L8717 +++$+++ u129 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MRS. JORDAN +++$+++ Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
L8420 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It's okay, Dan
L8419 +++$+++ u129 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MRS. JORDAN +++$+++ Excuse us, dear.
L8806 +++$+++ u127 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
L8805 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ But how...?
L8804 +++$+++ u127 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
L8803 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L8802 +++$+++ u127 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ He's inside you, where he hides.
L8801 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Where is he?
L8793 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
L8792 +++$+++ u127 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Mommy...?
L8657 +++$+++ u127 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ My friend, with the funny hand.
L8656 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Who says I don't like you?
L8654 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Who said I...wait, what?
L8653 +++$+++ u127 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
L8652 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
L8651 +++$+++ u127 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ She doesn't want me around
L8650 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
L8649 +++$+++ u127 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ No...
L8648 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Is that who you're waiting for?
L8645 +++$+++ u127 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Been having bad dreams.
L8644 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
L8543 +++$+++ u127 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
L8542 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ How did you know that?
L8541 +++$+++ u127 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
L8540 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ My name is...
L8539 +++$+++ u127 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ It's lonely in there, in my room.
L8538 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
L8536 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Huh?
L8535 +++$+++ u127 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Hey...wake up.
L8414 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Me too.
L8413 +++$+++ u125 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ There you go.  Love you.
L8412 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You're right.
L8411 +++$+++ u125 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
L8410 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yeah...I guess.
L8409 +++$+++ u125 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
L8408 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
L8407 +++$+++ u125 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ About him?
L8405 +++$+++ u125 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
L8404 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
L8403 +++$+++ u125 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
L8402 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know.
L8401 +++$+++ u125 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
L8400 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ The tickets.
L8397 +++$+++ u125 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Sorry, babe.
L8396 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Jesus!  Don't do that!
L8395 +++$+++ u125 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Hi, beautiful.
L8783 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE'S DAD +++$+++ Now.
L8782 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ But Dad --
L8781 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE'S DAD +++$+++ No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
L8780 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I've got to go.
L8779 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE'S DAD +++$+++ Alice!
L8580 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE'S DAD +++$+++ No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
L8579 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You disappointed in me?
L8578 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE'S DAD +++$+++ Since my little girl became a mom...
L8577 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Since when are you such a smart shopper?
L8576 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE'S DAD +++$+++ Alice...
L8575 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Very funny.
L8574 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE'S DAD +++$+++ Sobering...
L8573 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ How was the meeting?
L8525 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
L8524 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE'S DAD +++$+++ I'm so sorry, honey...
L8451 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It's just across the park.
L8450 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE'S DAD +++$+++ You sure you don't want a ride to work?
L8449 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Thanks for everything, Dad.
L8447 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ To take a picture.
L8446 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE'S DAD +++$+++ Where are we going?
L8444 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE'S DAD +++$+++ It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
L8443 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Dad!
L8442 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE'S DAD +++$+++ No.  A deal's a deal.
L8441 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
L8440 +++$+++ u124 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE'S DAD +++$+++ I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
L8439 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I was afraid you weren't coming.
L8819 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
L8818 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ He sure loves to stay awake.
L8817 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ So did Dan.
L8816 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ You do good work, Alice.
L8778 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
L8777 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ But how are we gonna --
L8776 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
L8775 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ What?
L8770 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ If they actually bothered to bury her.
L8769 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ You think that's the place she's buried?
L8760 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
L8759 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Are you alright?
L8705 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That's the only reason you're alive...
L8704 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
L8700 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
L8699 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
L8698 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
L8697 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
L8696 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Krueger is reality.
L8695 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
L8677 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
L8676 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
L8675 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
L8674 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
L8673 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
L8672 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
L8621 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Why don't you two stick to reality.
L8620 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
L8614 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
L8613 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
L8565 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
L8564 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What's that got to do with it?
L8552 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
L8551 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Did everyone call everyone?
L8547 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
L8546 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ There aren't any little boys on your floor.
L8545 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
L8523 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
L8522 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
L8394 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
L8393 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
L8365 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No, the Dan part was nice...
L8364 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
L8363 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Had kind of a long night.
L8362 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
L8743 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
L8742 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don't understand.
L8741 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ No shit.
L8740 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Poor woman...
L8739 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
L8738 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ But I've seen her grave.
L8737 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
L8736 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Meaning?
L8735 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
L8734 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
L8733 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ That's their problem.
L8732 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ They think I'm nuts.
L8711 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Then we'll find another way.
L8710 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
L8671 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
L8670 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Where are you going?
L8668 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don't know!
L8667 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
L8665 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ What, you named it already?
L8664 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ My baby!
L8663 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Who's Jacob?
L8640 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
L8639 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
L8638 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
L8637 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
L8634 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Nobody thinks that.
L8633 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
L8627 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Mark!
L8626 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Then get out!
L8617 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ She must've fallen asleep at the table...
L8616 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I thought about that.
L8612 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
L8611 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
L8610 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Yeah.  I'm just aces.
L8609 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Mark, are you okay?
L8557 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
L8556 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I've got to write some of this down.
L8424 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Well we gotta do something!
L8423 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
L8383 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
L8382 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
L8377 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
L8376 +++$+++ u123 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
L8495 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
L8494 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
L8490 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
L8489 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Who?
L8488 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
L8422 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
L8421 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
L8381 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
L8380 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
L8375 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ My undying love.  Have some.
L8374 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Next life.  Oh, what's that?
L8373 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
L8571 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ All of us.  Right?
L8570 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
L8563 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
L8562 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
L8559 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ I want to talk about the baby.
L8558 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
L8484 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
L8483 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
L8482 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Have another one, sounds like you need it.
L8427 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
L8426 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ Yeah...
L8425 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
L8367 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Makes you look like a nun--
L8366 +++$+++ u126 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ GRETA +++$+++ These things are wild...  What do you think?
L8703 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ He invited me to his house last night.
L8702 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ You, too?
L8630 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Stick around, please?
L8629 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ It's okay.
L8625 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ I can't listen to this.
L8624 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
L8623 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Mark...
L8622 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
L8499 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Faint.
L8498 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Vomit?
L8481 +++$+++ u130 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ YVONNE +++$+++ Two hours a day, six days a week.
L8480 +++$+++ u128 +++$+++ m8 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
L55857 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
L55856 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
L55855 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ I don't know.
L55854 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ But if they <u>do</u>?
L55853 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
L55852 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Which is the one - we have to worry about?
L55851 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Yes?
L55850 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
L55668 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ I'd sooner swim!
L55667 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
L55666 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ - any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
L55665 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
L55538 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
L55537 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Unidentified Flying Objects.
L55458 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
L55457 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
L55456 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
L55455 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
L55454 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
L55453 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
L55452 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
L55451 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
L55450 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ <u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
L55449 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
L55448 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
L55447 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
L55446 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
L55445 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ My father!  He's not - ?
L55444 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
L55443 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ What is it?
L55390 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
L55389 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ You could train someone else.
L55387 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
L55386 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
L55385 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ How is he - ?
L55384 +++$+++ u131 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
L55383 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
L55792 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
L55791 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Dave - !
L55770 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Oh it does???
L55769 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
L55762 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ I'm with <u>you!</u>
L55761 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Well?
L55759 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ We'll have to look for them later.
L55758 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
L55757 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Somewhere down there?
L55756 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
L55749 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ The sound again?
L55748 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ You hear that?
L55735 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
L55734 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
L55733 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ You know - it <u>is</u>?
L55732 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
L55729 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
L55728 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
L55727 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Listen!  Hear that?
L55726 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Yeah?
L55699 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
L55698 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ I think you're right.
L55697 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
L55696 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
L55689 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
L55688 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
L55662 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
L55661 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ 'Us?'
L55660 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ You've got to let us try, Skipper --
L55644 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
L55643 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ We're stuck tight!
L55571 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
L55570 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Cyclops?
L55436 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ 'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
L55435 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
L55434 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
L55433 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ A lot of people think like that.
L55432 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
L55431 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ So?
L55430 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
L55429 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ I guess.
L55428 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
L55426 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
L55425 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Huh?
L55424 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
L55355 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
L55354 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
L55353 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ <u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
L55352 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
L55351 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ So they caught up with you, too?
L55350 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Reef!
L55323 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Helen.  I appeal to you -
L55322 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
L55321 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
L55674 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ We hope!
L55673 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
L55672 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
L55671 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ The frogmen?
L55670 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ You better take Powell and Carney with you --
L55627 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Right at our one-eyed friend!
L55626 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ What course, Skipper?
L55622 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ What???
L55621 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
L55522 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
L55521 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Course and speed?
L55471 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ I...don't know!
L55470 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ What about down?
L55469 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Seems to be all around...
L55468 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Is there any way out of it?
L55380 +++$+++ u132 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Right, Skipper.
L55379 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
L55714 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ What????
L55713 +++$+++ u133 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ GRIFF +++$+++ We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
L55712 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Why do you say that?
L55711 +++$+++ u133 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ GRIFF +++$+++ The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
L55710 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Something wrong?
L55709 +++$+++ u133 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ GRIFF +++$+++ Skipper - could you take a look here...?
L55546 +++$+++ u133 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ GRIFF +++$+++ All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
L55545 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Yes, Griff?
L55544 +++$+++ u133 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ GRIFF +++$+++ Excuse me, Skipper---
L55827 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ What about time...?
L55826 +++$+++ u134 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
L55825 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Anything ---
L55824 +++$+++ u134 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
L55741 +++$+++ u134 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ Radiation level...constantly rising...
L55740 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Now they feel it...down below.
L55705 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
L55704 +++$+++ u134 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ Wonderful!
L55703 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
L55833 +++$+++ u134 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
L55832 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ All ready?
L55744 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
L55743 +++$+++ u134 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ There's got to be an explanation!
L55742 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ As we near the Pole...
L55717 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ What direction does the system indicate?
L55716 +++$+++ u134 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
L55564 +++$+++ u134 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
L55563 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ ....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
L55559 +++$+++ u134 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
L55558 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ <u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
L55557 +++$+++ u134 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
L55496 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
L55495 +++$+++ u134 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
L55494 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ ...above Murmansk, and Finland.
L55467 +++$+++ u134 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
L55466 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ Under <u>water</u>?
L55465 +++$+++ u134 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
L55838 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Minus three.
L55837 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
L55823 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Nothing we can do, now.
L55822 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
L55654 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
L55653 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ What?
L55652 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
L55647 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
L55646 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
L55645 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
L55631 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ We can <u>ram</u> him!
L55630 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ But - what can we accomplish?
L55629 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ That's what I said!
L55628 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Right <u>at</u> him?
L55615 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Thirty-four seconds!
L55614 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ What's the running time?
L55597 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Take a look.
L55596 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ You're sure it's Cyclops?
L55514 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ After torpedo room:  Report!
L55513 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Determine extent of damage, immediately.
L55418 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ I think I should have joined the Air Force!
L55417 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ What do you think?
L55378 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
L55377 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Huh?
L55376 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ 'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
L55375 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
L55374 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Who with?
L55373 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
L55361 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ I met Dr. Kent, once.
L55360 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
L55359 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
L55808 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ <u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
L55807 +++$+++ u136 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SAUCER VOICE +++$+++ Obviously.
L55806 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
L55805 +++$+++ u136 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SAUCER VOICE +++$+++ Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
L55804 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
L55803 +++$+++ u136 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SAUCER VOICE +++$+++ It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
L55799 +++$+++ u136 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SAUCER VOICE +++$+++ I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
L55798 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Why?
L55797 +++$+++ u136 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SAUCER VOICE +++$+++ On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
L55796 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
L55790 +++$+++ u136 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SAUCER VOICE +++$+++ I am afraid not.  Therefore -
L55789 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ He did!
L55788 +++$+++ u136 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SAUCER VOICE +++$+++ Your friend was to remain where he was!
L55787 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Swell!
L55785 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ - for horrors like yourself?
L55784 +++$+++ u136 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SAUCER VOICE +++$+++ My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
L55777 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
L55776 +++$+++ u136 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SAUCER VOICE +++$+++ Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
L55775 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ That's a <u>face</u>???
L55765 +++$+++ u135 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ REEF +++$+++ Come where?
L55764 +++$+++ u136 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SAUCER VOICE +++$+++ Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
L55829 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ All right - go to it.
L55828 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
L55719 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ Toward the Pole!
L55718 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
L55555 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
L55554 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
L55549 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
L55548 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
L55532 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
L55531 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
L55519 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ I'll be another!
L55518 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ Well, I'll be - !
L55482 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
L55481 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ See what?
L55367 +++$+++ u137 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ SIR IAN +++$+++ Thank you.
L55366 +++$+++ u138 +++$+++ m9 +++$+++ WENDOVER +++$+++ My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
L12762 +++$+++ u139 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
L12761 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
L12760 +++$+++ u139 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ No.
L12759 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Twombley involved?
L12758 +++$+++ u139 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
L12757 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What is the Northcountry Development Association?
L12756 +++$+++ u139 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
L12754 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
L12753 +++$+++ u139 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ Has anybody offered to buy it?
L12752 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
L12751 +++$+++ u139 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
L12750 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You don't believe me?
L12749 +++$+++ u139 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
L12748 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ ...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
L12747 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
L12746 +++$+++ u139 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ Who?
L12745 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
L12744 +++$+++ u139 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ Who?
L12743 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
L12742 +++$+++ u139 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ Always has been.
L12741 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
L12740 +++$+++ u139 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
L12739 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
L12738 +++$+++ u139 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ Are you alright, Wade?
L12737 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No. Black.
L12736 +++$+++ u139 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ALMA +++$+++ Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
L12735 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You got yourself a computer, Alma.
L12780 +++$+++ u140 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ CHICK +++$+++ He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
L12779 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
L12778 +++$+++ u140 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ CHICK +++$+++ Chub says you're fired.
L12777 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Tell me.
L12776 +++$+++ u140 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ CHICK +++$+++ LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
L12775 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah. I know about that.
L12774 +++$+++ u140 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ CHICK +++$+++ -- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
L12773 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
L12772 +++$+++ u140 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ CHICK +++$+++ The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
L12141 +++$+++ u140 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ CHICK +++$+++ Same old shit.
L12140 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What are you boys up to?
L12680 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
L12679 +++$+++ u141 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ HAND +++$+++ You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
L12678 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Oh.
L12677 +++$+++ u141 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ HAND +++$+++ Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
L12676 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
L12675 +++$+++ u141 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ HAND +++$+++ Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
L12674 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yes.
L12673 +++$+++ u141 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ HAND +++$+++ No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
L12672 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
L12671 +++$+++ u141 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ HAND +++$+++ Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
L12670 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ This spring.
L12669 +++$+++ u141 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ HAND +++$+++ How soon?
L12668 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I plan to. Soon.
L12667 +++$+++ u141 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ HAND +++$+++ It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
L12666 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
L12733 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That was me.
L12732 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ We bought you.
L12731 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You can't buy Wade off.
L12730 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
L12729 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Shit! What are we gonna do?
L12728 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ He's on to us!
L12402 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
L12401 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
L12400 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
L12399 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
L12398 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
L12390 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
L12389 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
L12388 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ You see it?
L12381 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.
L12380 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ I hear Twombley got shot.
L12379 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You heard the news.
L12300 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
L12299 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
L12284 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Deers have ears too.
L12283 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ Sun's gettin high.
L12282 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This way.
L12281 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ Yeah.
L12280 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Safety on?
L12278 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
L12277 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ What happened?
L12276 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
L12275 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ Hmm.
L12274 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ They said.
L12273 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ Really.
L12272 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
L12271 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ Oh.
L12270 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Double A. New Britain.
L12269 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ You played for the Sox?
L12268 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Drafted by the Red Sox.
L12267 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ Yeah?
L12266 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I used to play ball.
L12265 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
L12264 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ I'm okay.
L12254 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Wonderful!
L12253 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
L12252 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
L12251 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
L12250 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Mmm.
L12249 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
L12248 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
L12247 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ You think so.
L12246 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You might not kill it.
L12245 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ Yeah.
L12244 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ If you get it?
L12243 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
L12242 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
L12241 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ Damn straight!
L12240 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
L12239 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ Guaranteed, eh?
L12238 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
L12237 +++$+++ u153 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ TWOMBLEY +++$+++ It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
L12661 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
L12660 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
L12659 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Open the door. We're late.
L12658 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
L12657 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Open the door, will ya?
L12656 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
L12655 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Lawford?
L12654 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm fucking out of here.
L12428 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ He sure as hell won't.
L12427 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
L12426 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.
L12425 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
L12424 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
L12423 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
L12422 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
L12421 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Saw him do it?
L12420 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What?
L12419 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Sure you did.
L12418 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
L12417 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
L12416 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
L12415 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
L12414 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
L12413 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ On your sleeve.
L12412 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What blood?
L12411 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Where'd you get the blood?
L12410 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.
L12409 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You stayed away?
L12408 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The ambulance guys lugged him up.
L12407 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
L12406 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
L12405 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No, I mean whereabouts.
L12404 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ In the chest.
L12403 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Where'd Twombley get shot?
L12204 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Piece of fucking cake.
L12203 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
L12198 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Shit.
L12197 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Bastard's got his high beams on.
L12196 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Right!
L12195 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
L12194 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
L12193 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Like you and Gordon?
L12190 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
L12189 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ How'd you get the job?
L12188 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
L12187 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
L12186 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
L12184 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Not here.
L12183 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
L12182 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
L12181 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
L12180 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I thought I told you to move that truck!
L12150 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
L12149 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No brag. Just fact.
L12148 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
L12147 +++$+++ u142 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
L12146 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Don't mind if I do.
L12835 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Okay, let's go home, then.
L12834 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I want to go home.
L12833 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
L12830 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Oh.
L12829 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
L12828 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ You're a policeman.
L12827 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I know.
L12826 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ That's illegal, you know.
L12825 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You can't.
L12824 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I want to go home.
L12823 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
L12822 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ What are you sorry for?
L12821 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Please don't cry. Please, honey.
L12819 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Fine.
L12818 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Okay.
L12817 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
L12816 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
L12815 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
L12814 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
L12813 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
L12812 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Nothing.
L12811 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What do you want, then?
L12810 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ No.
L12809 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
L12808 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
L12807 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ How about a Big Mac?
L12806 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Oh.
L12805 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Grandpa. My father. It's his.
L12804 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Pop?
L12803 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It belongs to Pop.
L12802 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ It's pretty old.
L12801 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
L12800 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Are we going in this?
L12598 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
L12597 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Dad.
L12179 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
L12178 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
L12177 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
L12176 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Yes.
L12175 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
L12174 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Yes.
L12173 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ That's all you got to say? "Yes".
L12172 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Yes.
L12171 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
L12170 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
L12169 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
L12168 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
L12167 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ See, I knew you'd be mad.
L12166 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
L12165 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
L12164 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jesus, why?
L12163 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Yes.
L12162 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What? You called Mommy? Just now?
L12161 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I called Mommy.
L12160 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
L12159 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
L12158 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
L12157 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
L12156 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No what?
L12155 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ No.
L12154 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
L12138 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
L12137 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
L12136 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It's fun.
L12135 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ It's stupid.
L12134 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What then?
L12133 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ It's not that.
L12132 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
L12131 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I don't want to.
L12130 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
L12127 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
L12126 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
L12125 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I just think you used to be bad.
L12124 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L12123 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I bet you did lots of bad things.
L12122 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
L12121 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ But it's not funny now.
L12120 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ To us it was.
L12119 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Was it funny?
L12118 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
L12117 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Did you do that when you were a kid?
L12116 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I guess they're stupid.
L12115 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Yeah. It's stupid.
L12114 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Break stuff?
L12113 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ You know.
L12112 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Do what?
L12111 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Why do they do that?
L12110 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
L12109 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I don't care. They're out.
L12108 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Those are the Hoyts.
L12107 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
L12106 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L12105 +++$+++ u143 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
L12104 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
L12767 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
L12766 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ The key, Wade.
L12765 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
L12764 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
L12703 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
L12702 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Could be.
L12701 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You and Mel Gordon?
L12700 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Maybe.
L12699 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I won't. You interested?
L12698 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
L12697 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Want to buy?
L12696 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
L12695 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
L12694 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
L12693 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You? Why?
L12692 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
L12691 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
L12690 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ So?
L12689 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
L12688 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
L12687 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What do I have to do for it?
L12684 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
L12683 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ On what you pay me?
L12682 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
L12681 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
L12576 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
L12575 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm fine, fine.
L12574 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ How you holding up, Wade?
L12397 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
L12396 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah. A few things.
L12395 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Something bugging you?
L12394 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
L12393 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
L12378 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
L12377 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You want me to follow them to Littleton?
L12376 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
L12375 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Like hell.
L12374 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
L12373 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
L12372 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
L12371 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
L12370 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
L12369 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You mean Twombley?
L12368 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
L12367 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
L12366 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
L12365 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
L12364 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I figured you already heard.
L12363 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Huh?
L12362 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
L12361 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ What's the hurry?
L12297 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
L12296 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Fuck you.
L12295 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
L12294 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm not saying that.
L12293 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ You don't want the extra police pay?
L12292 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
L12291 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Don't go playing policeman.
L12290 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
L12289 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Huh?
L12288 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ His son-in-law damn near killed me.
L12287 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
L12286 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Where's the plow?
L12285 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
L12235 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
L12234 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Tomorrow, Gordon.
L12129 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
L12128 +++$+++ u144 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LARIVIERE +++$+++ We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
L12798 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
L12797 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
L12796 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
L12795 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No problem. Look, I...
L12792 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Hi honey.
L12791 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ See. Get your boots.
L12790 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, lots.
L12789 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
L12604 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
L12603 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It's just...
L12602 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ We've done all our talking, Wade.
L12601 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ We should talk.
L12600 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
L12599 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
L12218 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
L12217 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
L12216 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I don't want her to go, Lillian.
L12213 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
L12212 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ She's grown up some, hasn't she?
L12211 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L12210 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
L12208 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
L12207 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
L12206 +++$+++ u145 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LILLIAN +++$+++ Where's Jill?
L12205 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Lillian!
L12262 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
L12261 +++$+++ u146 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LUGENE +++$+++ I still don't understand --
L12260 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Mel Gordon.
L12259 +++$+++ u146 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LUGENE +++$+++ Good. Who?
L12258 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I know who it is.
L12257 +++$+++ u146 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LUGENE +++$+++ Did you get his number?
L12256 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
L12255 +++$+++ u146 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ LUGENE +++$+++ Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
L12844 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
L12843 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
L12842 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
L12841 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Going somewhere, Margie?
L12785 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
L12784 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
L12783 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
L12782 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
L12713 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
L12712 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ What happened?
L12582 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Wade.
L12581 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ This is nuts.
L12534 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I don't know for Christ's sake!
L12533 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ How?
L12532 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Of course! I would've heard.
L12531 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Think they're alright?
L12530 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Strange.
L12529 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
L12528 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
L12527 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
L12526 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I know your parents.
L12525 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
L12524 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
L12516 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Good.
L12515 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Alright. I'll think about it.
L12514 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
L12513 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You've been married twice --
L12512 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I've been thinking about it, that's all.
L12511 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Oh, Wade.
L12510 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
L12509 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Then... I guess you have to.
L12508 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
L12507 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
L12506 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ It's nice.
L12505 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
L12504 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ What way?
L12503 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
L12502 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You knew me as a kid.
L12501 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I can see what you looked like as a kid.
L12499 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ But not now.
L12498 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
L12497 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
L12496 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
L12495 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
L12494 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
L12493 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
L12492 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
L12491 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Jack doesn't need money.
L12490 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Money.
L12489 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
L12488 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
L12487 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ ...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
L12486 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
L12485 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
L12484 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
L12483 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
L12350 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Okay.
L12349 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Tonight. Let's get together.
L12348 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Call me.
L12344 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
L12343 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
L12342 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah. I mean that.
L12341 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You don't mean that.
L12340 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
L12339 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L12338 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Forget it.
L12337 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
L12336 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Said what?
L12335 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I'm sorry about what I said.
L12334 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L12333 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You okay?
L12233 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L12232 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You okay?
L12231 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ See you tomorrow, maybe.
L12230 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
L12225 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
L12224 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Okay. She's fine.
L12223 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ How's she doing?
L12222 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ For a while.
L12221 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
L12564 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
L12563 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Can --?
L12562 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ It makes me sad.
L12555 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Is...? She's dead then?
L12554 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ When did she die?
L12553 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Coffee's perked.
L12550 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
L12549 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
L12548 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You're not using it today?
L12547 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ There's a furnace.
L12546 +++$+++ u147 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
L12482 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
L12481 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yes. Here's your ticket.
L12480 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
L12479 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
L12478 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
L12477 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
L12476 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ Hold on!
L12475 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
L12474 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
L12473 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
L12472 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
L12471 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
L12470 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
L12469 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ How's that?
L12468 +++$+++ u148 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MEL GORDON +++$+++ Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
L12467 +++$+++ u149 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MRS. GORDON +++$+++ Can't it wait, then?
L12466 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
L12465 +++$+++ u149 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MRS. GORDON +++$+++ Something about my father?
L12464 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
L12463 +++$+++ u149 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MRS. GORDON +++$+++ Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
L12462 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
L12461 +++$+++ u149 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MRS. GORDON +++$+++ He's asleep. We were up very late.
L12460 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
L12459 +++$+++ u149 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ MRS. GORDON +++$+++ Who are you?
L12840 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
L12839 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ He got his deer yet?
L12838 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
L12837 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ His office. You mean my old office.
L12836 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
L12832 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
L12831 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
L12358 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
L12357 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
L12356 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Where... how'd you hear that?
L12355 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ The other guy.
L12354 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jack?
L12353 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
L12352 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
L12351 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You talked to Jack?
L12347 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Marg! You got orders!
L12346 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
L12345 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Marg!
L12331 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
L12330 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ This town sucks.
L12329 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
L12328 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
L12327 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
L12326 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What?
L12325 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It don't look right.
L12229 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
L12228 +++$+++ u150 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Take care, Wade.
L12864 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
L12863 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
L12862 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Crawl!
L12861 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
L12860 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You and me.
L12859 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Bang!
L12858 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L12857 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Everything you know is from me.
L12856 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Call it what you want.
L12855 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Love! I'm made of love!
L12854 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
L12853 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
L12852 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
L12851 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
L12719 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
L12718 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Pop, for Christ's sake!
L12590 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
L12589 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
L12561 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
L12560 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
L12559 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ In the living room.
L12558 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Is there something wrong with the phone?
L12557 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
L12556 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L12545 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ She's coming.
L12544 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Where's Ma?
L12542 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L12541 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
L12540 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
L12539 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
L12538 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You remember Margie Fogg?
L12537 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Sleeping.
L12536 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
L12324 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ You no-good pup!
L12323 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Nothing.
L12322 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
L12312 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ Atta-go.
L12311 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Just do it.
L12310 +++$+++ u151 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ POP +++$+++ A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
L12309 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Rolfe.
L12771 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
L12770 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
L12769 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ For what?
L12768 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
L12727 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
L12726 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Wade, are you alright?
L12725 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
L12649 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ That's what you think.
L12648 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
L12647 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, I never heard that one.
L12646 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
L12645 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
L12644 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
L12643 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
L12642 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ It may have happened, but not the way you said.
L12641 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
L12640 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
L12639 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah.
L12638 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
L12637 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
L12636 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
L12635 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Not particularly.
L12634 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
L12633 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
L12632 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ A hunting accident is perfect.
L12631 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
L12630 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
L12629 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
L12628 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
L12627 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I don't know. You tell me.
L12626 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
L12625 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
L12624 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Money.
L12623 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Motive. You gotta have a motive.
L12622 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
L12621 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Then who shot him?
L12620 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ That it wasn't an accident.
L12619 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Which is?
L12618 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
L12617 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Find them everywhere. 
L12616 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Want to know what I think happened?
L12615 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
L12614 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
L12613 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
L12612 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
L12611 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Well, do you still plan to get married?
L12610 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ What about her?
L12609 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ What about Margie?
L12573 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah. I forgot.
L12572 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ No thanks. I don't drink.
L12571 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
L12569 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
L12568 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
L12458 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
L12457 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Haven't you already done a bit of that?
L12456 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
L12455 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Get some sleep.
L12454 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, I guess.
L12453 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
L12452 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
L12451 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ What happened?
L12450 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
L12449 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Who?
L12448 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
L12447 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ How was she?
L12446 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ The night before the shooting.
L12445 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Huh?
L12444 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Lillian was here. In Lawford.
L12443 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
L12442 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, it was an accident.
L12441 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ You think Jack shot him?
L12440 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No shit.
L12439 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Twombley.
L12438 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Who?
L12437 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
L12436 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
L12435 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
L12434 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
L12433 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
L12432 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ There was something. It happened up your way.
L12431 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
L12430 +++$+++ u152 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ ROLFE +++$+++ Wade?
L12429 +++$+++ u154 +++$+++ m10 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Rolfe.
L17221 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Jim... for godsake!
L17220 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Daddy. Daddy, please...
L17000 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
L16999 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes dear?
L16998 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Mom?
L16676 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
L16675 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
L16674 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That's not really the point.
L16673 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Some kids were teasing you?
L16672 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
L16671 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Your father never means to be so...
L16670 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
L16669 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
L16668 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm sorry, honey.
L16667 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
L16666 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
L16665 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
L16664 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Back at The Fishbowl?
L16663 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
L16662 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
L16661 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Alice...
L16660 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
L16658 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Don't you even want to ask?
L16657 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I'm sure he's busy.
L16656 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You don't want to say hi to your father?
L16653 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yeah, no duh.
L16652 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, you aren't the President, dear.
L16651 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
L17197 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ You are a resilient man, Mr.
L17196 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He didn't leave us.
L17107 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
L17106 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
L17061 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
L17060 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ The woman you shot. She was my friend.
L16918 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
L16917 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
L16916 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
L16915 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
L16914 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
L16907 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
L16906 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
L16905 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don't drink coffee.
L17398 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Okay, I'm slowing us down.
L17397 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ There they are!
L17301 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
L17300 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
L17288 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Been better, Dad... You?
L17287 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ How you doing, sweetie?
L17217 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Alice... I...
L17216 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Daddy...
L16754 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Daddy...
L16753 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Alice!
L16682 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ How `bout a hug for the old man.
L16681 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It was the experience of a lifetime.
L16680 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ How was...  ...the ballet?
L16679 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Hey, you guys back already?
L16678 +++$+++ u155 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Oooooh, I'm good.
L17310 +++$+++ u156 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CERALLOS +++$+++ Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
L17309 +++$+++ u163 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ IRAQI SOLDIER +++$+++ The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
L17308 +++$+++ u156 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CERALLOS +++$+++ The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
L17307 +++$+++ u163 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ IRAQI SOLDIER +++$+++ They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
L17306 +++$+++ u156 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CERALLOS +++$+++ It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
L17305 +++$+++ u163 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ IRAQI SOLDIER +++$+++ Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
L17304 +++$+++ u156 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CERALLOS +++$+++ Did we warn them off?
L17303 +++$+++ u163 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ IRAQI SOLDIER +++$+++ The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
L17077 +++$+++ u157 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CHIEF MECHANIC +++$+++ cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
L17076 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ It's cut.
L17071 +++$+++ u157 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CHIEF MECHANIC +++$+++ Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
L17070 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
L17069 +++$+++ u157 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CHIEF MECHANIC +++$+++ Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
L17068 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Got it.
L17067 +++$+++ u157 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ CHIEF MECHANIC +++$+++ Do you see the maintenance panel?
L17379 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
L17378 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
L17377 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
L17376 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Lemme take a look.
L17375 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
L17374 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
L17373 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Uh, we got a problem here.
L17359 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
L17358 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ How we doing, Colonel?
L17357 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Stay cool.
L17356 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Got it.
L17355 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
L17354 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
L17350 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I'm doing what I can.
L17349 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Who's flying the fucking plane?
L17348 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ He's busy being dead.
L17347 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Put your pilot on.
L17346 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ You read my mind.
L17345 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
L17338 +++$+++ u158 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ COL. CARLTON +++$+++ Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
L17337 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
L17384 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
L17383 +++$+++ u159 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ I prefered the terrorists.
L17382 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
L17279 +++$+++ u159 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ This doesn't make sense.
L17278 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ They aren't answering their hails.
L16849 +++$+++ u159 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
L16848 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ Walter, if you have a point, make it.
L16844 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
L16843 +++$+++ u159 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ We don't know that.
L16842 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ He's dead then. They must have killed him.
L16718 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
L16717 +++$+++ u160 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DOHERTY +++$+++ The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
L16591 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
L16590 +++$+++ u160 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DOHERTY +++$+++ Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
L16581 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
L16580 +++$+++ u160 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DOHERTY +++$+++ It was a good ad-lib, sir.
L16579 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
L16578 +++$+++ u160 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ DOHERTY +++$+++ Sir, you threw out page two.
L17386 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ To swear you in as President.
L17385 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
L17285 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
L17284 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
L17283 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
L17195 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
L17194 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
L16881 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
L16880 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
L16879 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ But they start executing hostages in
L16878 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
L16877 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ Can we do that?
L16801 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
L16800 +++$+++ u161 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GENERAL NORTHWOOD +++$+++ General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
L17204 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ My loyalty was never to my country.
L17203 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
L17202 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ Because it is my duty.
L17201 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Why?
L17200 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ Yes, Mr. President.
L17199 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
L17170 +++$+++ u164 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KC-135 PILOT +++$+++ Ga get it.
L17169 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ That's affirmative.
L17166 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ Roger.
L17165 +++$+++ u164 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KC-135 PILOT +++$+++ Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
L17164 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
L17163 +++$+++ u164 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KC-135 PILOT +++$+++ Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
L17162 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ About goddamn time.
L17161 +++$+++ u164 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KC-135 PILOT +++$+++ Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
L17095 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
L17094 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
L17093 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Where are we now?
L17092 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
L17091 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ We're not going to make it.
L17090 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
L17083 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
L17082 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
L17081 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ How?
L16995 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ Well it worked.
L16994 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
L16993 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ why did they do that?
L16992 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
L16890 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ A secret service agent. It must be.
L16889 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
L16888 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Who did this?
L16791 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Any of us?
L16790 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ Nine.
L16789 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ How many others killed?
L16788 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ Dead.
L16787 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ The rest of the secret service?
L16573 +++$+++ u162 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ GIBBS +++$+++ Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
L16572 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ We've already been inspected.
L17451 +++$+++ u176 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ TOWER +++$+++ Copy, Air Force One.
L17450 +++$+++ u165 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KC-LO PILOT +++$+++ This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
L17449 +++$+++ u176 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ TOWER +++$+++ Tower, here.
L17448 +++$+++ u165 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KC-LO PILOT +++$+++ We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
L17446 +++$+++ u176 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ TOWER +++$+++ Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
L17445 +++$+++ u165 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KC-LO PILOT +++$+++ Stand by.
L17444 +++$+++ u176 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ TOWER +++$+++ Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
L17413 +++$+++ u176 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ TOWER +++$+++ Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
L17412 +++$+++ u165 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KC-LO PILOT +++$+++ Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
L17036 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
L17035 +++$+++ u170 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You're pointing a gun at me.
L17031 +++$+++ u170 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Scared. We're scared.
L17030 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
L17029 +++$+++ u170 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
L17028 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
L17027 +++$+++ u170 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Maria... Maria Mitchell.
L17026 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ *                     Please tell me your name.
L16617 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Thank you.
L16616 +++$+++ u170 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
L16614 +++$+++ u170 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
L16613 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ And all these rooms here?
L16612 +++$+++ u170 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I guess it depends on your perspective.
L16611 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ A dubious distinction, no?
L16610 +++$+++ u170 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
L16609 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ This is a remarkable aircraft.
L16608 +++$+++ u170 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
L16585 +++$+++ u170 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
L16584 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
L17248 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
L17247 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
L17225 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Three...
L17224 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Jim...
L17223 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Four...
L17210 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
L17209 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
L17154 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
L17153 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
L17105 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Say something dear.
L17104 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No.
L17103 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
L17059 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
L17058 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ That was war.
L17057 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
L17056 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ How can you? I mean they're people.
L17055 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
L17054 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Why? Do you enjoy it?
L17053 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Yes
L17052 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Do you have to be so brutal?
L16913 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
L16912 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ My husband is a very courageous man.
L16911 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ I know he left you behind.
L16910 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What do you know of my husband?
L16909 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
L16908 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Leave my daughter alone.
L16895 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Come on, Alice.
L16894 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Now, or he dies, please.
L16817 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
L16816 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What do you want with us?
L16815 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
L17298 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Hold on, Alice.
L17297 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
L17295 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
L17294 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
L17293 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ There goes your ride.
L17251 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ One thing I've learned as
L17250 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
L17235 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
L17234 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Someday, you'll regret my nature.
L17232 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Good. Good.
L17231 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
L17230 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ You'll do it?
L17229 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Stop.
L17214 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
L17213 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
L17212 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
L17211 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
L17208 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
L17207 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Over my dead body.
L17206 +++$+++ u166 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ KORSHUNOV +++$+++ Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
L17100 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
L17099 +++$+++ u167 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Finally, we can bargain.
L16873 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
L16872 +++$+++ u167 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
L16807 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
L16806 +++$+++ u167 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Twenty minutes?
L16805 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
L16804 +++$+++ u167 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
L17174 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ That isn't necessary.
L17173 +++$+++ u168 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MAJOR CALDWELL +++$+++ Sir, we stay with the President.
L17159 +++$+++ u168 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MAJOR CALDWELL +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L17158 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I'll not going without my family.
L17140 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Got it.
L17139 +++$+++ u168 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MAJOR CALDWELL +++$+++ Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
L17138 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
L17132 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
L17131 +++$+++ u168 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MAJOR CALDWELL +++$+++ We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
L17130 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
L17122 +++$+++ u168 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MAJOR CALDWELL +++$+++ Gravity.
L17121 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
L16720 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
L16719 +++$+++ u168 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MAJOR CALDWELL +++$+++ The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
L16716 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ They've gotta be joking.
L16715 +++$+++ u168 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MAJOR CALDWELL +++$+++ Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
L17331 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
L17330 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Flying the plane.
L17329 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L17262 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Both of you.
L17261 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
L17241 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Please... don't start with me.
L17240 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I don't know why you stayed.
L16709 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
L16708 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
L16706 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
L16705 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ How did your speech go?
L16704 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
L16703 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
L16702 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I'll make it up to you, I promise.
L16701 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I wish it were that easy...
L16700 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
L16699 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I miss you. And I miss her.
L16698 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What?
L16697 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ You know what?
L16694 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
L16693 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
L16692 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ She's a big girl.  She understands.
L16691 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
L16690 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Rose, I don't have time for this.
L16689 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
L16688 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No, Mr. President.  It can't.
L16687 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Can't it wait?
L16686 +++$+++ u171 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ May I speak to you for a moment?
L17150 +++$+++ u173 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
L17149 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Someone should give you a raise.
L17148 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ White House Situation room.
L17147 +++$+++ u173 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Where are we sending it?
L17137 +++$+++ u173 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ No. I thought about this, Mr.
L17136 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
L17135 +++$+++ u173 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ The fax machines.
L17134 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Excuse me?
L17133 +++$+++ u173 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ The fax machines.
L17010 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
L17009 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
L17008 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ But this is different, sir. You're the President.
L17007 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
L17006 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ and if that means negotiating...
L17005 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
L17004 +++$+++ u177 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ V.P. CHANDLER +++$+++ They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
L17003 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Did they say anything about my family?
L16766 +++$+++ u172 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SECRET SERVICE AGENT +++$+++ Two... THREE. GO!
L16765 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ But...
L16764 +++$+++ u172 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SECRET SERVICE AGENT +++$+++ One.
L16738 +++$+++ u172 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SECRET SERVICE AGENT +++$+++ We're handling it, sir.
L16737 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Where's my family?
L16736 +++$+++ u172 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SECRET SERVICE AGENT +++$+++ We're under attack.
L16735 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ What's going on?
L16934 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
L16933 +++$+++ u175 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SWITCHBOARD +++$+++ Thank you for calling the white House...
L16932 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
L16931 +++$+++ u175 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SWITCHBOARD +++$+++ Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
L16930 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
L16929 +++$+++ u175 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SWITCHBOARD +++$+++ Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
L16928 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
L16927 +++$+++ u175 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SWITCHBOARD +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L16926 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ This is the President.
L16925 +++$+++ u175 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SWITCHBOARD +++$+++ who can I say is calling?
L16924 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
L16923 +++$+++ u175 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SWITCHBOARD +++$+++ White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
L17404 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ We're hooked. Hove into position.
L17403 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ WE'RE HOOKED!
L17400 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ DO YOU SEE TEEM?
L17399 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ IT'S OPEN!
L17396 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ They better. Fuel's almost gone.
L17395 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
L17325 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Twenty-five years.
L17324 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ How long's it been since you flew, sir?
L17323 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Shit.
L17322 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
L17321 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
L17313 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ A MiG? Where the hell are we?
L17312 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ My god. I think that was a MiG.
L17260 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Sir...
L17259 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Shepherd.
L17116 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
L17115 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
L16684 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
L16683 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
L16648 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L16647 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
L16635 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ That's my job.
L16634 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ You give me ulcers.
L16633 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ We'll just say it was in bad taste.
L16632 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
L16605 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Did we tape the Duke game?
L16604 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
L16603 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ It's bait.  Don't take it.
L16597 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
L16596 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Other way around, sir.
L16595 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
L16594 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ *                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
L16593 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I might still have a few chips left.
L16592 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
L16589 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ He and the NRA don't like the wording.
L16588 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
L16587 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ You wanna knock of f?
L16577 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
L16576 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ *                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
L19087 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ Commissioner, Aquarius.
L19086 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ Kruger, Sagittarius.
L19032 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
L19031 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
L19030 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ What's the story?
L19029 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ I was reading too.
L19028 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ Forget it.  I was reading.
L18588 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
L18587 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
L18586 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
L18585 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ That just doesn't make any sense.
L18584 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
L18382 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ I just wish it was that simple.
L18381 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ What?
L18380 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ Commissioner.
L18379 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
L18375 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
L18374 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
L18373 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
L18372 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
L18863 +++$+++ u185 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
L18862 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ What is it, Mary?
L18861 +++$+++ u185 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
L18860 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ Felt like a large asteroid.
L18859 +++$+++ u185 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes I did...
L18858 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ Did you feel that?
L18825 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ You better take this.
L18824 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ Sir?
L18823 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Dunn.
L18822 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
L18821 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
L18785 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ You better check it, Unger.
L18784 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
L18716 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ Accelerators down.
L18715 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Shut down accelerators.
L18636 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Dunn.
L18635 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ Oveur.
L19239 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
L19238 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, the lever!
L19215 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Compute!
L19214 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Now!
L19213 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Set!
L19212 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
L19199 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
L19198 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Not when I'm with you, Ted.
L19197 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Are you afraid?
L19196 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
L19195 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What will happen to him, Ted?
L19194 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's right -- premature ejection.
L19193 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You mean...
L19192 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
L19191 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Simon just ejected!
L19132 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That might be the news we've been waiting for.
L19131 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
L19130 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
L19119 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ That was very well put, Ted.
L19118 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
L19113 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I mean until we start to burn up.
L19112 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Not now, Elaine.
L19111 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
L19053 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, please be careful.
L19052 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
L19012 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, there's no time to explain.
L19011 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine, what's going on?
L19010 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted!
L19009 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine!
L18801 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
L18800 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
L18799 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'd use the word insane.
L18798 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
L18797 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
L18796 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What word would you use, Elaine?
L18795 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I've never used the word insane, Ted.
L18794 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
L18793 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
L18792 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
L18791 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
L18790 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine, we have to go back.
L18789 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
L18788 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine.
L18698 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted!
L18697 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Not now, Elaine!
L18696 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted.
L18695 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
L18694 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What are you doing, Ted?
L18677 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Let me by, Elaine.
L18676 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, we're taking off!
L18675 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
L18674 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted!  What are you...?
L18569 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
L18568 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
L18567 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ If that's the way you want it.
L18566 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
L18564 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
L18563 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
L18559 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
L18558 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
L18557 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
L18556 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Who's that, Ted?
L18555 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
L18548 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
L18547 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine, what happened to us?
L18546 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
L18545 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine.
L18529 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
L18528 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
L18527 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ There's nothing wrong with me!
L18526 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
L18525 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Ask Simon.
L18524 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, what's wrong?
L18512 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
L18511 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
L18510 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's got to be stopped!
L18506 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
L18505 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Te...!
L18504 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine.
L18701 +++$+++ u190 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RUMACK +++$+++ Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
L18700 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Is he making any progress, Doctor?
L18699 +++$+++ u190 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RUMACK +++$+++ The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
L18690 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Is that a good sign, Doctor?
L18689 +++$+++ u190 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RUMACK +++$+++ You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
L18688 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I mean for Ted.
L18687 +++$+++ u190 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RUMACK +++$+++ You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
L18686 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
L18685 +++$+++ u190 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RUMACK +++$+++ So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
L18684 +++$+++ u190 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RUMACK +++$+++ The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
L18683 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
L19179 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Simon, what are you saying?!
L19178 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Maybe.
L19177 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
L18907 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
L18906 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ My career is shot.
L18904 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
L18903 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Can't we change course?
L18902 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
L18901 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Simon, what's happening?!
L18757 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Roger.
L18756 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
L18750 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ That's my girl.
L18749 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I think so.
L18748 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Have you got it straightened out now?
L18543 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Don't be too long.
L18542 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
L18533 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ So mentally ill?
L18532 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Simon, why has he become so... so...
L18531 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
L18503 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No, I've been excited before.
L18502 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I guess this is a first for you.
L18501 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'm so excited, Simon.
L18500 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Frank's the best pilot in the program.
L18397 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
L18396 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
L18395 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
L18394 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
L18393 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
L18392 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Simon.
L18391 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
L18873 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
L18872 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
L18871 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
L18870 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You can do it from up here, Captain.
L18869 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Roger.
L18868 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
L18867 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
L18866 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
L18718 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L18717 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
L18856 +++$+++ u189 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ROK +++$+++ There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
L18855 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
L18854 +++$+++ u189 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ROK +++$+++ Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
L18853 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Request; life support systems check.
L18852 +++$+++ u189 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ROK +++$+++ Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
L18851 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
L18755 +++$+++ u189 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ROK +++$+++ You have great tits.
L18754 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Go ahead.
L18753 +++$+++ u189 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ROK +++$+++ Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
L18752 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ That's okay, ROK.
L18751 +++$+++ u189 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ROK +++$+++ Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
L18725 +++$+++ u189 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ROK +++$+++ Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
L18724 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ That's not possible.
L18723 +++$+++ u189 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ROK +++$+++ Negative.
L18722 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
L18721 +++$+++ u189 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ROK +++$+++ Negative.
L18720 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
L18781 +++$+++ u183 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
L18780 +++$+++ u181 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
L18779 +++$+++ u183 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
L18776 +++$+++ u183 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
L18775 +++$+++ u181 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
L18774 +++$+++ u183 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
L18773 +++$+++ u181 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
L18409 +++$+++ u183 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
L18408 +++$+++ u181 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
L18844 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
L18843 +++$+++ u181 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah.
L18842 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ He's a boy dog.
L18841 +++$+++ u181 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Sure.
L18840 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Can I hold him?
L18839 +++$+++ u181 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Scraps.
L18838 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
L18617 +++$+++ u194 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ What...?
L18616 +++$+++ u182 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ All right.  Here.
L18615 +++$+++ u194 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
L18614 +++$+++ u182 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't want to hear that word!
L18613 +++$+++ u194 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
L18612 +++$+++ u182 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
L18611 +++$+++ u194 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
L19151 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm sure.
L19150 +++$+++ u182 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're sure?
L19149 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
L19148 +++$+++ u182 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What?
L19147 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
L19146 +++$+++ u182 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't want to live anymore.
L19145 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
L18875 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
L18874 +++$+++ u185 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
L18768 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Poached!  Not over!  Over!
L18767 +++$+++ u185 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
L18766 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
L18764 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Just poached on toast.  Over.
L18763 +++$+++ u185 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
L18762 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ No.  Poached.  Over.
L18761 +++$+++ u185 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
L18760 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
L19141 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
L19140 +++$+++ u185 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What should I say?
L19139 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
L19138 +++$+++ u185 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ A b...
L19137 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ He's carrying a bomb.
L19136 +++$+++ u185 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sixteen 'C', why?
L19135 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
L18682 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
L18681 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Whenever your're ready, Captain.
L18632 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
L18631 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
L18598 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
L18597 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
L18593 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
L18592 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
L18591 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Captain Oveur?
L18475 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
L18474 +++$+++ u187 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
L18473 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
L18472 +++$+++ u187 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
L18471 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Yes.
L18470 +++$+++ u187 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
L18469 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
L18468 +++$+++ u187 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ You folks need any help?
L18608 +++$+++ u188 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
L18607 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Don't try to stop me!
L18606 +++$+++ u188 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ You can't go in there!
L18605 +++$+++ u188 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
L18604 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ All right, it's a matter of death.
L18603 +++$+++ u188 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
L18602 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
L18601 +++$+++ u188 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Do you have an appointment, sir?
L18600 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I have to see Bud Kruger.
L18989 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
L18988 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
L18987 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Then Elaine was right.
L18986 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
L18985 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
L18984 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Striker.
L18519 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
L18518 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
L18517 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
L18516 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
L18509 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
L18508 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Are you on the Mercury mission?
L18816 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
L18815 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
L18814 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
L18813 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
L18812 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
L18811 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
L18810 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
L18809 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
L18808 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
L18807 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ No.  I mean your relationship.
L18806 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
L18805 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Do you want to talk about it.
L18804 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
L18803 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
L18802 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You've been hurt.
L18541 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
L18540 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
L18539 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
L18538 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
L18537 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
L18536 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
L18535 +++$+++ u192 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?
L19838 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
L19837 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
L19836 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ No. I'm all alone.
L19835 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
L19714 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
L19713 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
L19712 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
L19711 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
L19710 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
L19709 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
L19708 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
L19707 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
L19706 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
L19402 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
L19401 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
L19400 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
L19399 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
L19398 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Thank you. Cream?
L19397 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ Ah, won't you sit down?
L19396 +++$+++ u195 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ BERNICE +++$+++ That's very nice of you. Thank you.
L19395 +++$+++ u205 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
L19611 +++$+++ u207 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MRS. KRAMER +++$+++ Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
L19610 +++$+++ u196 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ CAREY +++$+++ ...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
L19608 +++$+++ u207 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MRS. KRAMER +++$+++ Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
L19607 +++$+++ u196 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ CAREY +++$+++ Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
L19606 +++$+++ u207 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MRS. KRAMER +++$+++ Something about a plane with no pilot?
L19605 +++$+++ u196 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ CAREY +++$+++ Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
L19604 +++$+++ u207 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MRS. KRAMER +++$+++ Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
L19603 +++$+++ u207 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MRS. KRAMER +++$+++ Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
L19602 +++$+++ u196 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ CAREY +++$+++ Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
L19789 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
L19788 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
L19787 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ George Zipp said that?
L19757 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
L19756 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Surely there must be something you can do.
L19755 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
L19754 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
L19753 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
L19736 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
L19735 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ ...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
L19653 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
L19652 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
L19633 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
L19632 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
L19631 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Surely you can't be serious.
L19630 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Can you fly this airplane and land it?
L19629 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Both pilots!
L19554 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
L19553 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
L19551 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
L19550 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ You can't take a guess for another two hours?
L19549 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Well...not for another two hours.
L19548 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Can't you take a guess?
L19545 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ I can't tell.
L19544 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Captain, how soon can we land?
L19601 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
L19600 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No. No one that I know of.
L19599 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Well...
L19598 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
L19597 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No.
L19596 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
L19576 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
L19575 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Just how serious is it, doctor?
L19573 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ He had fish, too.
L19572 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
L19571 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
L19559 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ He had fish.
L19558 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ What did he have?
L19557 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
L19556 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
L19555 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ What was it we had for dinner tonight?
L19541 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Certainly.
L19540 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
L19539 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ A hospital? What is it?
L19538 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
L19534 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ Yes. Yes, of course.
L19533 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
L19532 +++$+++ u197 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ DR. RUMACK +++$+++ That's right.
L19531 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
L19857 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L19856 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ See them, Elaine?
L19833 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ The gear is down.
L19832 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
L19831 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
L19830 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Yes?
L19829 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted...
L19781 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
L19780 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ But Ted, you're the only...
L19775 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
L19774 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
L19773 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Rats! I've lost number three.
L19693 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
L19692 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
L19691 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
L19690 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
L19689 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ And a little ice!
L19688 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ And a little ice.
L19687 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Rain.
L19651 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
L19650 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
L19514 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
L19513 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
L19512 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
L19473 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
L19472 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What's his problem?
L19468 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
L19467 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
L19466 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
L19465 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
L19464 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
L19463 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Headquarters!? What is it?
L19462 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You got a telegram from headαuarters today.
L19460 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
L19459 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
L19458 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
L19457 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I remember everything. All I have are memories.
L19456 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
L19422 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I love you.
L19421 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ I love you, Elaine.
L19420 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
L19419 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
L19418 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What's the matter?
L19385 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
L19384 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
L19383 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, what are you doing here?
L19314 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
L19313 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ But if you'll just give me...
L19312 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
L19311 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ You expect me to believe that?
L19310 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
L19309 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
L19308 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
L19307 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
L19306 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
L19305 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
L19297 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
L19296 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
L19295 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
L19294 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
L19293 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I just don't want to go over it any more.
L19292 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
L19291 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted!
L19290 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Elaine!
L19526 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
L19525 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
L19524 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Airsick?
L19504 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Who wants to be first?
L19503 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
L19437 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
L19436 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ We'd better get back now.
L19425 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Hello.
L19424 +++$+++ u198 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ We have a visitor.
L19368 +++$+++ u213 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ Good-bye, darling.
L19367 +++$+++ u199 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
L19366 +++$+++ u213 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ Good-bye, darling.
L19365 +++$+++ u199 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
L19364 +++$+++ u213 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
L19363 +++$+++ u199 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
L19362 +++$+++ u213 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ Good-bye, darling.
L19333 +++$+++ u199 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Every day.
L19332 +++$+++ u213 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ You promise you'll write.
L19331 +++$+++ u199 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
L19849 +++$+++ u203 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ KRAMER +++$+++ All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
L19848 +++$+++ u200 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ GUNDERSON +++$+++ He's right on the heading.
L19825 +++$+++ u203 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ KRAMER +++$+++ Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
L19824 +++$+++ u200 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ GUNDERSON +++$+++ He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
L19817 +++$+++ u203 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ KRAMER +++$+++ You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
L19816 +++$+++ u200 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ GUNDERSON +++$+++ Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
L19809 +++$+++ u200 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ GUNDERSON +++$+++ Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
L19808 +++$+++ u203 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ KRAMER +++$+++ Did you decide on a runway yet?
L19807 +++$+++ u200 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ GUNDERSON +++$+++ Yes, Captain?
L19806 +++$+++ u203 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ KRAMER +++$+++ And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
L19705 +++$+++ u201 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Here.
L19704 +++$+++ u211 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
L19703 +++$+++ u201 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How ya doing, honey?
L19518 +++$+++ u201 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What is it?
L19517 +++$+++ u211 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Oh, I can't stand it.
L19330 +++$+++ u211 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
L19329 +++$+++ u201 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
L19280 +++$+++ u201 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
L19279 +++$+++ u211 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ SHIRLEY +++$+++ Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
L19454 +++$+++ u208 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MURDOCK +++$+++ The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
L19453 +++$+++ u202 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ ...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
L19452 +++$+++ u208 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MURDOCK +++$+++ We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
L19451 +++$+++ u202 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ ...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
L19450 +++$+++ u208 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MURDOCK +++$+++ Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
L19449 +++$+++ u202 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
L19448 +++$+++ u208 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MURDOCK +++$+++ I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
L19445 +++$+++ u208 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MURDOCK +++$+++ I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
L19444 +++$+++ u202 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
L19442 +++$+++ u208 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MURDOCK +++$+++ I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
L19441 +++$+++ u202 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
L19493 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Okay, this is one of my favorites.
L19492 +++$+++ u204 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Oh, I'd love to.
L19491 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
L19490 +++$+++ u204 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
L19489 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ I'm Randy.
L19488 +++$+++ u204 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Hi!
L19570 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
L19569 +++$+++ u206 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MRS. HAMMEN +++$+++ Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
L19568 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
L19567 +++$+++ u206 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MRS. HAMMEN +++$+++ Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
L19566 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Yes?
L19477 +++$+++ u206 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MRS. HAMMEN +++$+++ I will, but Jim won't.
L19476 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
L19447 +++$+++ u208 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MURDOCK +++$+++ All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
L19446 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
L19435 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ No, why don't you take care ot it?
L19434 +++$+++ u208 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MURDOCK +++$+++ Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
L19376 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
L19375 +++$+++ u208 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MURDOCK +++$+++ We have clearance, Clarence.
L19372 +++$+++ u208 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MURDOCK +++$+++ Huh?
L19371 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Roger.
L19370 +++$+++ u208 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MURDOCK +++$+++ Huh?
L19369 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Roger.
L19325 +++$+++ u209 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
L19324 +++$+++ u208 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ MURDOCK +++$+++ Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
L19484 +++$+++ u212 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ SISTER ANGELINA +++$+++ Of course.
L19483 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
L19482 +++$+++ u212 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ SISTER ANGELINA +++$+++ Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
L19481 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
L19480 +++$+++ u212 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ SISTER ANGELINA +++$+++ Yes?
L19479 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Excuse me, Sister?
L19828 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
L19827 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
L19625 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Would you go up, please?
L19624 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
L19623 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
L19622 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ The cockpit? What is it?
L19621 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
L19475 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ No. No thank you.
L19474 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
L19378 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
L19377 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Do you feel all right, sir?
L19344 +++$+++ u214 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ STRIKER +++$+++ Thank you.
L19343 +++$+++ u210 +++$+++ m13 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
L24643 +++$+++ u215 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Yeah...
L24642 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ You okay?
L24424 +++$+++ u215 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
L24423 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ I like my horizons narrow.
L24422 +++$+++ u215 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
L24421 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
L24420 +++$+++ u215 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
L24419 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
L24418 +++$+++ u215 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
L24417 +++$+++ u215 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
L24416 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
L24415 +++$+++ u215 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
L24413 +++$+++ u215 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
L24412 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
L24411 +++$+++ u215 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
L24616 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Show me.
L24615 +++$+++ u215 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ In there.
L24408 +++$+++ u215 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
L24407 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
L24406 +++$+++ u215 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ He's not here.  Why ask me?
L24404 +++$+++ u215 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
L24403 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
L24402 +++$+++ u215 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ That's right.
L24401 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ You are Cassandra?
L24530 +++$+++ u216 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ FEDORCHUK +++$+++ I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
L24529 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Lay off, asshole.
L24528 +++$+++ u216 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ FEDORCHUK +++$+++ Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
L24526 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
L24525 +++$+++ u216 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ FEDORCHUK +++$+++ Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
L24192 +++$+++ u216 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ FEDORCHUK +++$+++ You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
L24191 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ You don't have squat.
L24190 +++$+++ u216 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ FEDORCHUK +++$+++ Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
L24189 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
L24655 +++$+++ u217 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ HARCOURT +++$+++ No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
L24654 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
L24316 +++$+++ u217 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ HARCOURT +++$+++ That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
L24315 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
L24314 +++$+++ u217 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ HARCOURT +++$+++ Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
L24309 +++$+++ u217 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ HARCOURT +++$+++ Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
L24308 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
L24307 +++$+++ u217 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ HARCOURT +++$+++ Yes...
L24306 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ William Harcourt?
L24640 +++$+++ u217 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ HARCOURT +++$+++ Do it!
L24639 +++$+++ u219 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ KIPLING +++$+++ Here?
L24638 +++$+++ u217 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ HARCOURT +++$+++ Kill them both.
L24464 +++$+++ u217 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ HARCOURT +++$+++ This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
L24463 +++$+++ u219 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ KIPLING +++$+++ When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
L24326 +++$+++ u217 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ HARCOURT +++$+++ It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
L24325 +++$+++ u219 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ KIPLING +++$+++ He didn't recognize me.
L24324 +++$+++ u217 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ HARCOURT +++$+++ This is becoming a serious breach of security.
L24323 +++$+++ u219 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ KIPLING +++$+++ That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
L24700 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ You look very good.
L24699 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ How do I look?
L24686 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ You understand that.  But how many others will?
L24685 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ But there's no more drug.
L24684 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
L24683 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
L24682 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ We can't let him get away.
L24681 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
L24680 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Tell me about it...
L24679 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
L24678 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Harcourt is dead.
L24677 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ ... It's Harcourt.
L24676 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ What is this?!
L24672 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Do what?!  George-- ?!
L24671 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ No!  We must do this alone.
L24670 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
L24669 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ What's this about, George?  I know that look.
L24657 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
L24656 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
L24651 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Ss-ai!
L24650 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Shit!
L24610 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Fuck procedure.
L24609 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ 
L24608 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
L24607 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
L24606 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
L24599 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
L24598 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
L24594 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
L24593 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Uh, George...
L24588 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
L24587 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
L24586 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
L24585 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
L24584 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
L24565 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
L24564 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
L24563 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
L24562 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
L24561 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
L24560 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
L24559 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ We all did.
L24558 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ We?  You've taken it?
L24557 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
L24556 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ How potent?
L24555 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ ... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
L24554 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
L24553 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
L24552 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
L24550 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ You must leave me alone on this.
L24549 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
L24537 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ ... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
L24536 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
L24535 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ ... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
L24534 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Nothing.
L24533 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ What was that about?
L24519 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Thank you.
L24518 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
L24516 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Stop the car!
L24515 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
L24514 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Please, I must get out here.
L24513 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Why?
L24512 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Stop the car.
L24511 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
L24510 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ To the... to the beach?
L24509 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Well, let's roll, George.
L24504 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
L24503 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
L24502 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ She's going to divorce me.
L24501 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
L24500 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Where'd you get this?!!
L24496 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
L24495 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ I'm going home.
L24490 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
L24489 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
L24488 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.
L24487 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
L24486 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
L24485 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Ta ss'trakyona'...
L24484 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Your health...
L24483 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
L24482 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ In the other man's rectum.
L24481 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ ... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
L24478 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
L24477 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
L24475 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ I appreciate your honesty, George.
L24474 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
L24473 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
L24472 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
L24471 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Was.  Divorced.
L24470 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ You are married?
L24469 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Yeah... I know the routine.
L24468 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ My wife?  She worries about me.
L24467 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
L24446 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
L24445 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ I believe he is probably lying.
L24440 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ When will Strader return?
L24439 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
L24432 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
L24431 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Who is he?
L24400 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
L24399 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
L24398 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
L24397 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
L24396 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
L24394 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
L24393 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
L24392 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ This is mole.  It's good.
L24391 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Which one is that?  Raw what?
L24387 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
L24386 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
L24384 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
L24383 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
L24375 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
L24374 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
L24373 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
L24372 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ You know that guy?
L24368 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Stay back!  I'm okay.
L24367 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Matthew, you don't have to-- .
L24366 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
L24365 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Your mother mates out of season.
L24364 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Tell me.
L24361 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Screw me?  That can't be right.
L24360 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Screw you.
L24356 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ I'll handle it.
L24355 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ But I-- .
L24354 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Back off, George.
L24353 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Uh, Matthew...
L24352 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
L24346 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ At the end of the bar.
L24345 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Who said that?
L24339 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
L24338 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
L24337 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Why'd I do what?
L24336 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Why did you do it?
L24313 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
L24312 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
L24302 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
L24301 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Did you talk to him?
L24300 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
L24299 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
L24298 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
L24297 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Did you learn anything?
L24296 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
L24284 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
L24283 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ I believe I should interview the widow alone.
L24282 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
L24281 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
L24280 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ How the hell do you know that?
L24279 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
L24276 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ And still it fits?
L24275 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
L24274 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ And that fits?
L24273 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Get the picture?
L24271 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
L24270 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ What is this?
L24269 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
L24268 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Nothing?
L24267 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Nothing.
L24266 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ What's this?  What's going on?
L24248 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
L24247 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
L24246 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
L24245 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Well... yes, quite possibly.
L24244 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
L24243 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ What is wrong?
L24241 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
L24240 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Yes.
L24239 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
L24238 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
L24237 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
L24236 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
L24235 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
L24233 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Nice signal, dickwad!
L24232 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
L24231 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
L24230 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
L24229 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Let's talk Hubley.
L24227 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
L24226 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
L24225 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
L24224 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
L24223 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?
L24221 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ I am George.
L24220 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
L24219 +++$+++ u218 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ JETSON +++$+++ Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
L24218 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ ... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
L24333 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ No... two.
L24332 +++$+++ u220 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ MAFFET +++$+++ Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
L24331 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Only holds five.
L24330 +++$+++ u220 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ MAFFET +++$+++ Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
L24329 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ What is it?
L24328 +++$+++ u220 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ MAFFET +++$+++ You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
L24601 +++$+++ u221 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ O'NEAL +++$+++ ... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
L24600 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
L24294 +++$+++ u221 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ O'NEAL +++$+++ Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
L24293 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ That where Anderson worked?
L24292 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
L24291 +++$+++ u221 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ O'NEAL +++$+++ Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
L24290 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Who else can I ask around here?
L24289 +++$+++ u221 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ O'NEAL +++$+++ To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
L24288 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
L24287 +++$+++ u221 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ O'NEAL +++$+++ You think this is the guy who did it?
L24286 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
L24285 +++$+++ u221 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ O'NEAL +++$+++ Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
L24579 +++$+++ u222 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ Sure.  Just a minute.
L24578 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
L24575 +++$+++ u222 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
L24574 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
L24573 +++$+++ u222 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
L24570 +++$+++ u222 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ For you, anything.
L24569 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
L24568 +++$+++ u222 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
L24381 +++$+++ u223 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
L24380 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Yeah, I heard of it.
L24379 +++$+++ u223 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
L24378 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
L24359 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ What's that?
L24358 +++$+++ u223 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Ss'kya'ta'.
L24357 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
L24546 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Did he find anything?
L24545 +++$+++ u227 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ WINTER +++$+++ Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
L24544 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ What kind of test?
L24539 +++$+++ u227 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ WINTER +++$+++ You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
L24538 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
L24265 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Yeah, I'll bet.
L24264 +++$+++ u227 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ WINTER +++$+++ Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
L24263 +++$+++ u227 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ WINTER +++$+++ That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
L24262 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
L24261 +++$+++ u227 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ WINTER +++$+++ Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
L24260 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Yeah.
L24259 +++$+++ u227 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ WINTER +++$+++ You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
L24258 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
L24257 +++$+++ u227 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ WINTER +++$+++ No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
L24254 +++$+++ u227 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ WINTER +++$+++ Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
L24253 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ The human?
L24252 +++$+++ u227 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ WINTER +++$+++ Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
L24251 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
L24250 +++$+++ u227 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ WINTER +++$+++ You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
L24216 +++$+++ u226 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ WARNER +++$+++ Don't tell me what to think.
L24215 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
L24214 +++$+++ u226 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ WARNER +++$+++ Granger and Pitts are already on it.
L24210 +++$+++ u226 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ WARNER +++$+++ You?
L24209 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Departmental policy.
L24208 +++$+++ u226 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ WARNER +++$+++ You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
L24204 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
L24203 +++$+++ u226 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ WARNER +++$+++ Yeah, Sykes?
L24167 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
L24166 +++$+++ u225 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ TUGGLE +++$+++ I can't!  Do you mind!
L24165 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Get outta there!
L24163 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ I got him.  Don't get pinned.
L24162 +++$+++ u225 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ TUGGLE +++$+++ Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
L24161 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
L24160 +++$+++ u225 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ TUGGLE +++$+++ Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
L24159 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ You got your vest?
L24156 +++$+++ u225 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ TUGGLE +++$+++ Whatever gave you that idea?
L24155 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Does that look at all suspicious to you?
L24153 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
L24152 +++$+++ u225 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ TUGGLE +++$+++ But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
L24151 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
L24150 +++$+++ u225 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ TUGGLE +++$+++ Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
L24149 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ What?
L24148 +++$+++ u225 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ TUGGLE +++$+++ Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
L24147 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ How can I go?
L24145 +++$+++ u225 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ TUGGLE +++$+++ It is. 
L24144 +++$+++ u224 +++$+++ m14 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ Hope their plumbing's the same.
L26618 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
L26617 +++$+++ u228 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ APONE +++$+++ Talk to me, Hudson.
L26616 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Can't lock up...
L26615 +++$+++ u228 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ APONE +++$+++ Position?
L26614 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Movement!
L26401 +++$+++ u228 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ APONE +++$+++ Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
L26400 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
L26399 +++$+++ u228 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ APONE +++$+++ Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
L26398 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
L26387 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Would you, Sir?
L26386 +++$+++ u228 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ APONE +++$+++ Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
L26385 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ This floor's freezing.
L26632 +++$+++ u228 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ APONE +++$+++ Say again?  All after incinerators?
L26631 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
L26606 +++$+++ u228 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ APONE +++$+++ Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
L26605 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
L26487 +++$+++ u228 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ APONE +++$+++ Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
L26486 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
L26485 +++$+++ u228 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ APONE +++$+++ Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
L26484 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
L26480 +++$+++ u228 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ APONE +++$+++ Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
L26479 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Okay, let's do it.
L26474 +++$+++ u228 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ APONE +++$+++ Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
L26473 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ ...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
L26972 +++$+++ u229 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Well, thanks, I --
L26971 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You did okay, Bishop.
L26945 +++$+++ u229 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
L26944 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
L26943 +++$+++ u229 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Ripley...
L26942 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
L26941 +++$+++ u229 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
L26940 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ HOW MUCH TIME?
L26808 +++$+++ u229 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ See you soon.
L26807 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
L26803 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
L26802 +++$+++ u229 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
L26801 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What?
L26800 +++$+++ u229 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ I'll go.
L26789 +++$+++ u229 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
L26788 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ And it's too late to shut it down?
L26785 +++$+++ u229 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
L26784 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ How long until it blows?
L26783 +++$+++ u229 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
L26759 +++$+++ u229 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
L26758 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Could it be intelligent?
L26757 +++$+++ u229 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
L26756 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
L26755 +++$+++ u229 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
L26754 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
L26753 +++$+++ u229 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Yes.  That follows.
L26752 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
L26751 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
L26750 +++$+++ u229 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
L26774 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Sorry to disappoint you.
L26773 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
L26770 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
L26769 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
L26768 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
L26767 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Now, wait a second --
L26766 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
L26765 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
L26764 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
L26763 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
L26682 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
L26681 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Corporal Hicks!?
L26680 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
L26679 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
L26678 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You son of a bitch.
L26673 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Bullshit!
L26672 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
L26671 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
L26670 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
L26669 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Why not?
L26668 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
L26667 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
L26597 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ She's right.
L26596 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
L26595 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
L26594 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
L26476 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
L26475 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ That the atmosphere processor?
L26442 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
L26441 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I hope you're right.  I really do.
L26408 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
L26407 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
L26378 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ That's the plan.  My word on it.
L26377 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
L26376 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
L26374 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
L26373 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
L26372 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
L26371 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
L26370 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ If I go.
L26369 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
L26368 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
L26367 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
L26366 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ That's right.
L26365 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
L26364 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
L26363 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
L26362 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What about you?  What's your interest in this?
L26357 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
L26356 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Hear me out...
L26355 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No.  There's no way!
L26309 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ You are a head case.  Have a donut.
L26308 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
L26307 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
L26287 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
L26286 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I get the picture.
L26285 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
L26284 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
L26280 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
L26279 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Amy.
L26278 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
L26277 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Is she...?
L26276 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
L26275 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Have they located my daughter yet?
L26266 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
L26265 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
L26602 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
L26601 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
L26550 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
L26549 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ What's he scanning for?
L26513 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ It's insured.
L26512 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
L26448 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Dead on all channels.
L26447 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Still nothing from the colony?
L26361 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
L26360 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
L26359 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
L26358 +++$+++ u230 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ BURKE +++$+++ Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
L26836 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Forget it.
L26835 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
L26834 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ How do you feel?
L26639 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ They're but off!  Do something!
L26638 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ I told them to fall back...
L26630 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Shut up.  Just shut up!
L26629 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
L26600 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ So?  So?
L26599 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
L26598 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ So.
L26587 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Proceed inside.
L26586 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I don't know.
L26585 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ What is it?
L26541 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
L26540 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Where are your parents?  You have to try...
L26528 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
L26527 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ One of us?
L26478 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ The structure seems intact.  They have power.
L26477 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
L26468 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Thirty-eight...simulated.
L26467 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
L26584 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ You tell me.  I only work here.
L26583 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
L26573 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
L26572 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Alive?
L26571 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
L26507 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
L26506 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Sir, the CPU is on-line.
L26504 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
L26503 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ ...We're coming in.
L26502 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
L26444 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
L26443 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Are there any questions?  Hudson?
L26423 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
L26422 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
L26421 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ What's the question?
L26420 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
L26419 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ Yes, Hicks?
L26418 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Sir?
L26417 +++$+++ u231 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ GORMAN +++$+++ At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
L26900 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Fuckin' A!
L26899 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Let's go!  Let's go!
L26895 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
L26894 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Well you're not reading it right!
L26884 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Let's get these things lit.
L26883 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Seventeen meters.
L26854 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Do it!
L26853 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ The corner!  Ready?
L26819 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
L26818 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
L26787 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
L26786 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ We got problems.
L26716 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Aye-firmative.
L26715 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
L26694 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Are you finished?  You okay?
L26693 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
L26627 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Not that tunnel, the other one!
L26626 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Let's get the fuck out of here!
L26460 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Sure, Hicks.
L26459 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Save it.
L26951 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Don't be long, Ellen.
L26950 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Ellen.
L26947 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ We ain't going anywhere.
L26946 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Hicks, don't let him leave.
L26938 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
L26937 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
L26903 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Stand back.
L26902 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Locked.
L26886 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ We didn't miss anything.
L26885 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
L26877 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
L26876 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ It's game time.
L26864 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Let's waste him.  No offense.
L26863 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
L26860 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
L26859 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
L26833 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Yeah.  I've noticed.
L26832 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
L26831 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
L26830 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What's this?
L26824 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
L26823 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
L26822 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Maybe.  Maybe not.
L26821 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ They'll get us.
L26817 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
L26816 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
L26813 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
L26812 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Now many?
L26810 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ On my way.
L26809 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ They're in the approach corridor.
L26714 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
L26713 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
L26712 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
L26703 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ About seventeen days.
L26702 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
L26525 +++$+++ u232 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HICKS +++$+++ Poor bastard.
L26524 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
L26873 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
L26872 +++$+++ u240 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VASQUEZ +++$+++ You're just reading me.
L26871 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ It's inside the complex.
L26791 +++$+++ u240 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VASQUEZ +++$+++ Hudson, give us a break.
L26790 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
L26675 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
L26674 +++$+++ u240 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VASQUEZ +++$+++ Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
L26666 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
L26665 +++$+++ u240 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VASQUEZ +++$+++ All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
L26439 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Anytime.  Anywhere.
L26438 +++$+++ u240 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VASQUEZ +++$+++ Fuck you.
L26437 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
L26389 +++$+++ u240 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VASQUEZ +++$+++ No.  Have you?
L26388 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
L26893 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ It's readin' right.  Look!
L26892 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Can't be.  That's inside the room!
L26891 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Nine meters.  Eight.
L26890 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
L26889 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
L26888 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
L26887 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Fifteen meters.
L26882 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Seal the door.
L26881 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Range twenty meters.
L26879 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Just get back here!
L26878 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
L26867 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
L26866 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ They cut the power.
L26799 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
L26798 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
L26796 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
L26795 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Think of what?  We're fucked.
L26794 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
L26793 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
L26792 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
L26724 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Uh, what's next?
L26723 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Thanks.
L26711 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
L26710 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
L26705 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
L26704 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
L26663 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
L26662 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
L26660 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
L26659 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Looks like it stung him.
L26431 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
L26430 +++$+++ u233 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ HUDSON +++$+++ Sounds like you, Hicks.
L26326 +++$+++ u238 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ SIMPSON +++$+++ Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
L26325 +++$+++ u234 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ LYDECKER +++$+++ So what do I tell this guy?
L26324 +++$+++ u238 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ SIMPSON +++$+++ Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
L26323 +++$+++ u234 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ LYDECKER +++$+++ There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
L26322 +++$+++ u238 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ SIMPSON +++$+++ Yeah.  What?
L26321 +++$+++ u234 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ LYDECKER +++$+++ You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
L26271 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No.. I've slept enough.
L26270 +++$+++ u235 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ MED-TECH +++$+++ Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
L26257 +++$+++ u235 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ MED-TECH +++$+++ Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
L26256 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ How long have I been on Gateway station?
L26255 +++$+++ u235 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ MED-TECH +++$+++ Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
L26254 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Terrible.
L26253 +++$+++ u235 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ MED-TECH +++$+++ And how are we today?
L26983 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
L26982 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Can we dream?
L26981 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ That's right.
L26980 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Are we going to sleep now?
L26979 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Right here, baby.  Right here.
L26978 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Mommy...Mommy?
L26957 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
L26956 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ I knew you'd come.
L26922 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Newt, wait!
L26921 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
L26912 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Sure.  Go left.
L26911 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
L26910 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Come on.  Crawl faster.
L26898 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Look!
L26897 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Burke!  Open the door!
L26851 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I know, honey.  Me too.
L26850 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
L26844 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
L26843 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Wah...?  Where are...?
L26842 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Newt.  Newt, wake up.
L26747 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
L26746 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Don't go!  Please.
L26743 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ You mean dead.
L26742 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Gone.
L26741 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Where is she?
L26740 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Yes.  A little girl.
L26739 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Did you ever have a baby?
L26738 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No, it's different, honey.
L26737 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
L26736 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
L26735 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Did one of those things grow inside her?
L26734 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
L26733 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Why do they tell little kids that?
L26732 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Yes, there are, aren't there.
L26731 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
L26730 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
L26729 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
L26726 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
L26725 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
L26697 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
L26696 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Newt.
L26695 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ I guess we're not leaving, right?
L26580 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You're really something, ace.
L26579 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
L26578 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
L26577 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
L26569 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ And hope to die?
L26568 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Cross my heart.
L26567 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ You promise?
L26566 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
L26565 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ They're dead.
L26564 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
L26562 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
L26561 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Why not?
L26560 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ I don't want you for a friend.
L26559 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What about me?
L26558 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Casey.  She's my only friend.
L26555 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
L26554 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What did you say?
L26318 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Sweet Jesus.
L26317 +++$+++ u239 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VAN LEUWEN +++$+++ Sixty, maybe seventy families.
L26316 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ How many colonists?
L26314 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What are you talking about. What people?
L26313 +++$+++ u239 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VAN LEUWEN +++$+++ Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
L26312 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Why won't you check out LV-426?
L26304 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ ...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
L26303 +++$+++ u239 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VAN LEUWEN +++$+++ Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
L26302 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
L26297 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
L26296 +++$+++ u239 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VAN LEUWEN +++$+++ The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
L26293 +++$+++ u239 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VAN LEUWEN +++$+++ It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
L26292 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Look, I told you...
L31167 +++$+++ u241 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ALLEGRO +++$+++ At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown!

L31166 +++$+++ u242 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ANDANTE +++$+++ A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.

L30091 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What do you mean?
L30090 +++$+++ u243 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ARCO +++$+++ His Grace is very angry with you.
L30089 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
L30088 +++$+++ u243 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ARCO +++$+++ Indeed.
L30087 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
L30086 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Certainly!
L30085 +++$+++ u243 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ARCO +++$+++ Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
L30321 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Meaning you didn't like it.
L30320 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Extremely clever.
L30319 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ What did you think of the music?
L30318 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You were sublime.
L30317 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ How was I? Tell me honestly.
L30316 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
L30315 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Well, what does it matter to you?
L30314 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ The marriage!
L30313 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What?
L30312 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Did you know? Had you heard?
L30251 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
L30250 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
L30249 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Why?
L30248 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You might be disappointed.
L30247 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ What does he look like?
L30246 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Perhaps.
L30245 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
L30244 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
L30243 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
L30242 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ A Turkish brothel.
L30241 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Oh!
L30240 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ A brothel.
L30239 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ What's that?
L30238 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ In a harem.
L30237 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Where?
L30236 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
L30235 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Why not?
L30234 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
L30233 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ How do you know?
L30232 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ No.
L30231 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Is there a part for me?
L30230 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes.
L30229 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
L30228 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
L30227 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
L30226 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
L30225 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
L30224 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Good morning.
L30223 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Maestro.
L30337 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
L30336 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
L30332 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
L30331 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What??
L30330 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Is she a good fuck?
L30325 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ I'm so relieved.
L30324 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, she's fine.
L30323 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Is her mother still lying on the floor?
L30322 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh - excuse me!
L30305 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I'll be right back.
L30304 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Don't bother.
L30303 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What?
L30302 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Don't bother!
L30301 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
L30356 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
L30355 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ You have leave to try.
L30354 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
L30353 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ And how will you make him keep it?
L30352 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
L30351 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
L30350 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Sir -
L30349 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
L30348 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
L30347 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ Hardly.
L30346 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
L30345 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ No! I won't have him back.
L30102 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
L30101 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
L30100 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
L30099 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
L30098 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
L30097 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Humiliated?
L30096 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
L30095 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why what, sir?
L30983 +++$+++ u246 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COMMENDATORE +++$+++ Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
L30982 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
L30954 +++$+++ u246 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COMMENDATORE +++$+++ Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
L30953 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
L30952 +++$+++ u246 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COMMENDATORE +++$+++ I've come to dinnnnnner!
L30951 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Who the devil are you? What do you want?
L30950 +++$+++ u246 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COMMENDATORE +++$+++ Don Giovannnnnnnni!
L31247 +++$+++ u256 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L31246 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
L31245 +++$+++ u256 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Why?
L31244 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Yes!
L31243 +++$+++ u256 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Now?
L31242 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I want to go back to Vienna.
L31241 +++$+++ u256 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Where?

L31026 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.

L30728 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -

L30410 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?

L30401 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ They'll come anyway. They love me here.
L30400 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
L30399 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, leave me alone.
L30398 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I think you're mad! You're really mad!

L30062 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Do you think that's funny?
L30061 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why? People fart backwards.
L30060 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ That's stupid.
L30059 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
L30058 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Why not?
L30057 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.

L31330 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
L31329 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
L31324 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
L31323 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
L31322 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ This is not his handwriting.
L31317 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ And I'm asking you -
L31316 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ He asked me to stay.

L31311 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Why you?
L31310 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
L31309 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L30482 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
L30481 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What?
L30480 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
L30464 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
L30463 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ But! I'm a married woman!
L30462 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
L30461 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Isn't it obvious?
L30460 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L30459 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Some service deserves service in return. No?
L30458 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ What for?
L30457 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Alone.
L30456 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Tonight?
L30455 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Come back tonight.
L30454 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Oh, thank you, sir!
L30453 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
L30451 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
L30450 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ It is miraculous.
L30445 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
L30444 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ These are originals?
L30443 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Yes.
L30442 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Originals?
L30441 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
L30440 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
L30439 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
L30438 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
L30434 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
L30433 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I see.
L30432 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ No, sir. This is my own idea.
L30431 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Then he didn't send you?
L30430 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
L30429 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Really?
L30428 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
L30427 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
L30426 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
L30425 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
L30424 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I understand.
L30423 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ He's terribly busy, sir.
L30422 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
L30421 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
L30420 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Frau Mozart?
L30419 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Madame. How can I help you?
L30418 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Excellency!
L31115 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
L31114 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
L31113 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Money! Money!
L31112 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
L31111 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
L31110 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
L31109 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ He's doing his best.
L31108 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
L31107 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Leave him alone!
L31106 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
L31085 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ I hope so. I need it immediately.
L31084 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
L31083 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Where's our friend?
L31082 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Not at all.
L31081 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Am I interrupting something?
L31017 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
L31016 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ How much will you pay him?

L30739 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
L30738 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
L30737 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
L30736 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
L30723 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
L30722 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
L30721 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
L30659 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ In three months! Papa.
L30658 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ When, may I ask?
L30657 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L30656 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ I see that you're expecting.
L30998 +++$+++ u263 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SECOND LADY +++$+++ Behold!
L30997 +++$+++ u248 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ Behold!
L30991 +++$+++ u263 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SECOND LADY +++$+++ Hey!
L30990 +++$+++ u248 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ Hey!
L30976 +++$+++ u263 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SECOND LADY +++$+++ Behold!
L30975 +++$+++ u248 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ Behold!
L30963 +++$+++ u263 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SECOND LADY +++$+++ Adorable!
L30962 +++$+++ u248 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ He's adorable!
L30957 +++$+++ u263 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SECOND LADY +++$+++ Be careful!
L30956 +++$+++ u248 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ Be careful!
L30268 +++$+++ u254 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MADAME WEBER +++$+++ Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
L30267 +++$+++ u249 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FLUNKY +++$+++ I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
L30264 +++$+++ u254 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MADAME WEBER +++$+++ Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
L30263 +++$+++ u249 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FLUNKY +++$+++ I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
L30262 +++$+++ u254 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MADAME WEBER +++$+++ Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
L30261 +++$+++ u249 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FLUNKY +++$+++ I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
L30260 +++$+++ u254 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MADAME WEBER +++$+++ Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
L30617 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Yes. He is a little strange.
L30616 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ What a strange young man.
L30606 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Michael!
L30605 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ I said play!
L30582 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
L30581 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
L30580 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
L30579 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Gertrude!
L30578 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
L30575 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ You can't be Herr Mozart!
L30574 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Gertrude!
L30573 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Upstairs.
L30602 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
L30601 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
L30600 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Who was your teacher?
L30599 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Just one year.
L30589 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Wine?
L30588 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
L30587 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
L30584 +++$+++ u250 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ FRAU SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Ah, now! Here she comes.
L30583 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Really?
L30889 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, look at them.
L30888 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
L30887 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Do you like this, Salieri?
L30521 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
L30520 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Yes?
L30519 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
L30518 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Really?
L30517 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
L30516 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Of course not.
L30515 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
L30514 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Oh?
L30513 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
L30512 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Why not?
L30511 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
L30510 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
L30378 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well. There it is.
L30377 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Sire.
L30376 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
L30375 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
L30374 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
L30373 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
L30372 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ And the result satisfies.
L30371 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
L30370 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Yes?
L30369 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
L30368 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
L30367 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
L30365 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Your Highness.
L30364 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
L30204 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
L30203 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
L30202 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, I'm glad to hear that.
L30179 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
L30178 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ My pleasure.
L30170 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
L30169 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
L30156 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah-ha!
L30155 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ A-flat, Majesty.
L30154 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
L30153 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You do me too much honour, Sire.
L30152 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
L30151 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Majesty.
L30150 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ May I try it?
L30149 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ It's just a trifle, of course.
L30148 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ What a charming idea. May I see?
L30124 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
L30123 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
L30833 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
L30832 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
L30831 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
L30821 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
L30820 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
L30819 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
L30818 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I have no idea.
L30817 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
L30816 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah, love again.
L30815 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
L30814 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
L30813 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
L30812 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
L30809 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
L30808 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Would you tell me why?
L30807 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, yes, I admit it is.
L30806 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
L30805 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Who told you this, Majesty?
L30804 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
L30803 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes, Sire.
L30802 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
L30768 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah! By all means.
L30767 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
L30766 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ What is it?
L30765 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
L30762 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Thank you, Sire!
L30761 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
L30296 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
L30295 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Twenty-six.
L30294 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Excuse me, but how old are you?
L30293 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
L30292 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
L30290 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Enchanted, Madame.
L30289 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
L30285 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
L30284 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
L30281 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
L30280 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
L30277 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
L30276 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What do you mean, Sire?
L30275 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
L30274 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
L30273 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
L30272 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ And German?
L30271 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Yes, indeed.
L30270 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
L30213 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I think so, Sire, yes.
L30212 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ What? On one hearing only?
L30211 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
L30195 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah-ha.
L30194 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
L30193 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Yes, where?
L30192 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
L30191 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
L30187 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
L30186 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Why so?
L30181 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
L30180 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Majesty!
L30177 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
L30176 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
L30168 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
L30167 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
L30166 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, thank you.
L30162 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
L30161 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Your Majesty!
L30146 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
L30145 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ He's here.
L30144 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Yes, what about him?
L30143 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
L30142 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well, what do you have for me today?
L30126 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Well. There it is.
L30125 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L30119 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
L30118 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
L30115 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
L30114 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
L30113 +++$+++ u251 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
L30775 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
L30774 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Father -
L30735 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ She does. She says I sleep all day.
L30734 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No one calls you that.
L30733 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
L30732 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Papa!
L30731 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
L30716 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
L30715 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Are you playing a trick on me?
L30714 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Mine?
L30713 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Papa, is this your idea?
L30683 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
L30682 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
L30679 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
L30678 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
L30673 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ This is just a game, Papa.
L30672 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ No, really!
L30669 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
L30668 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
L30662 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
L30661 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
L30660 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
L30652 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
L30651 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ You don't have secrets from me.
L30650 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It's a secret.
L30649 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Why not?
L30648 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, let's not talk about it.
L30647 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ What's that?
L30646 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ This one will.
L30645 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
L30644 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
L30643 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ How many?
L30642 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes.
L30641 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Yes.
L30640 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Pupils?
L30639 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ How many pupils do you have?
L30638 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
L30637 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ They say you're in debt.
L30636 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
L30635 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ That's not what I hear.
L30634 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It couldn't be better.
L30633 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ How is your financial situation?
L30632 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
L30631 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Don't you have a maid?
L30630 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
L30627 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
L30626 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Do you always live like this?
L30625 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
L30624 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Is she not here?
L30623 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
L30621 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
L30620 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Am I not welcome?
L30619 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why are you here?
L30359 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I will.
L30358 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
L31131 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Are you sure it's an opera?
L31130 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
L31129 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Opera? Opera!
L31128 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
L31127 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Is he working?
L31126 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
L31125 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Is he working?
L31124 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
L31123 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Where?
L31122 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ I don't know. He has pains.
L31121 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What medicine?
L31120 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
L31119 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Why? What has happened?
L31118 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
L31117 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
L30760 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ In there, sir.
L30759 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Where does he work?
L30757 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes what?
L30756 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ I think I've found out about the money, sir.
L30754 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
L30753 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
L30752 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Really? What is it he's writing?
L30751 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
L30750 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
L30749 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Not that I've seen.
L30748 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Do any pupils come to the house?
L30747 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Oh, thank you, sir.
L30222 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Bene.
L30221 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
L30135 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Bene! Bene!
L30134 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Yes, thank you, sir.
L30133 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
L30132 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ I will, sir.
L30131 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
L30130 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What have you got for me today? Let me see.
L30129 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Good morning, sir.
L30128 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
L30712 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
L30711 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
L30708 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
L30707 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What?
L30706 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
L30705 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ That's right.
L30704 +++$+++ u253 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LORL +++$+++ Are you Herr Mozart?
L30703 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes?
L31104 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ So let me see it. Where is it?
L31103 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, we can.
L31102 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
L31101 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Because there's nothing to see.
L31100 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Why not?
L31099 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No.
L31098 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Can I see it?
L31097 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes.
L31096 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
L31095 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What?
L31094 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
L31093 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
L31092 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ What is this?
L31091 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Put it down!
L31090 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Wolfi!
L31089 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Leave that alone!
L31015 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ So there you are. What do you say?
L31014 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
L31013 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
L31012 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ German!
L31011 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
L31010 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
L31009 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Animals?
L31008 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ 'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
L31007 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
L31006 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
L31005 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I liked the horse.
L31004 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Yes, well, it's all good fun.
L31003 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
L30920 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ That kind of music should be punishable by death.
L30919 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Sublime! Utterly sublime!
L30918 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well?
L30681 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
L30680 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ What did he say? What did he say?
L30496 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sssh! Stay here.
L30495 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
L30494 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sssh!
L31043 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ My answer is no, Mozart.
L31042 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
L31041 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ I'm sorry. No.
L31040 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
L31039 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
L31038 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
L31037 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ What for?
L31036 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
L31035 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
L31034 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
L31033 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
L31032 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
L31031 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
L30615 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
L30614 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
L30598 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
L30597 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
L30586 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
L30585 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
L30577 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
L30576 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I'm afraid I am.
L30572 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
L30571 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Madame.
L30570 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
L30568 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
L30567 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ And which one of them do you want me to teach?
L30566 +++$+++ u262 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHLUMBERG +++$+++ Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
L31308 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
L31307 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What for?
L31306 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I am so ashamed.
L31305 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I'm not leaving you.
L31304 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
L31303 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
L31302 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
L31301 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
L31300 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Do you want to rest a bit?
L31299 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
L31298 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes.
L31297 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Do you have it?
L31296 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You go fast!
L31295 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ And that's it. Do you have it?
L31292 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes!
L31291 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes, and on 'dictis'.
L31290 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
L31289 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
L31288 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
L31287 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ That's wonderful!
L31285 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Show me.
L31284 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I think so.
L31283 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Do you have me?
L31281 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
L31280 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ And that's all?
L31279 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
L31278 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Also identical?
L31277 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ With the tenors.
L31276 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
L31275 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It couldn't be simpler.
L31274 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Please! Just one moment.
L31273 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
L31272 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
L31271 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes.
L31270 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
L31269 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sing it back.
L31268 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I think so.
L31267 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
L31266 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes.
L31265 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
L31264 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Common time.
L31263 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What time?
L31262 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ The Fire.
L31261 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ So now - A minor. Suddenly.
L31260 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes.
L31259 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ We ended in F Major?
L31258 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Confutatis Maledictis.
L31257 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Come. Let's begin.
L31256 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Strange!
L31255 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L31254 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
L31253 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What?
L31252 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Do you believe in it?
L31251 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Consigned to flames of woe.
L31250 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
L31249 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
L31248 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Where did I stop?
L31238 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
L31237 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
L31236 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
L31235 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Of course.
L31234 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
L31233 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
L31232 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Would you? Actually, you could.
L31231 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
L31230 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
L31211 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ He knows. He knows!
L31210 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Finish what?
L31209 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
L31207 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What man?
L31206 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ The man. He's here.
L31205 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Who?
L31204 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No! No, it's him!
L31203 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Shall I answer it?
L31202 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I'm too young to be so sick.
L31201 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What?
L31200 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ The doctor thinks I am. But -
L31199 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Are you ill?
L31198 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
L31197 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I do.
L31196 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Do you mean that?
L31195 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
L31194 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ This is only a vaudeville.
L31193 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
L31192 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
L31191 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ No, please.
L31190 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
L31189 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You mean she's not coming back?
L31188 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
L31187 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Where is your wife?
L31183 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, no. I have to get back. I have -
L31182 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I'm taking you home. You're not well.
L31181 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What happened? Is it over?
L31134 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
L31133 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Are you neglecting my request?
L31132 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
L31062 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
L31061 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ How long will you give me?
L31059 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ How much?
L31058 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
L31057 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Who are you?
L31056 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
L31055 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What dead? Who is dead?
L31054 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ A Mass for the dead.
L31053 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What work?
L31052 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I have come to commission work from you.
L30929 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
L30928 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You flatter me.
L30927 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I never knew that music like that was possible.
L30926 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes?
L30925 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ How could it not, Excellency?
L30924 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Did my work please you?
L30923 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ How could I not?
L30922 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Mozart. It was good of you to come.
L30915 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
L30914 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
L30913 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
L30912 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
L30911 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
L30910 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
L30909 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
L30908 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I think it's marvelous. Truly.
L30907 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
L30906 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
L30905 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But what is it they don't like?
L30904 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
L30903 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
L30880 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Thank you! Oh, thank you.
L30879 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ With all my heart, Mozart.
L30878 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, Excellency, would you?
L30877 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
L30876 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
L30875 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ How fortunate.
L30874 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
L30873 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You burned the score?
L30872 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
L30871 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
L30870 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
L30869 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Really? Why?
L30868 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
L30867 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
L30565 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
L30564 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I can't say. Really
L30563 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What exactly are you working on?
L30562 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
L30561 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
L30560 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Ah. Italian?
L30559 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
L30558 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
L30557 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
L30556 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
L30555 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
L30554 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
L30553 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I'm afraid not.
L30552 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Do you have a daughter?
L30551 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Of course not.
L30550 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
L30549 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
L30548 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
L30547 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
L30546 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
L30545 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
L30544 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
L30543 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
L30542 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
L30541 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
L30540 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
L30539 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Herr Sommer.
L30538 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Whom did they choose?
L30537 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
L30536 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
L30535 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
L30534 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
L30533 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
L30532 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
L30531 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
L30530 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
L30529 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ So you are. How is your pretty wife?
L30528 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
L30527 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
L30329 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
L30328 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ How could I not?
L30327 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Did you like it, then?
L30326 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
L30283 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But this is absurd!
L30282 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
L30206 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
L30205 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Love, Sire!
L30175 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
L30174 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Ah!
L30173 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Mio caro Adone.
L30172 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Really?
L30171 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
L30895 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
L30894 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
L30864 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Taking out what you should never have put in.
L30863 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What are you doing, Herr Director?
L30860 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
L30859 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
L30858 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Exactly. A dance.
L30857 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
L30856 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
L30854 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Certainly, Herr Director.
L30853 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
L30837 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Just let me tell you how it begins.
L30836 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ That will do, Herr Mozart!
L30811 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ But, Your Majesty -
L30810 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
L30199 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
L30198 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Then why especially does it have to be in German?
L30197 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Exactly.
L30196 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ You mean in Turkey?
L30190 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ I think you'd better.
L30189 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
L30188 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Oh? Have I seen it?
L30839 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
L30838 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Herr Mozart -
L30397 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
L30396 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
L30395 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
L30394 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Mozart -
L30393 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
L30392 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Mozart -
L30391 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
L30390 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
L30389 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Who is on this committee?
L30388 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ A little modesty would suit you better.
L30387 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, but I'm the best.
L30386 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
L30385 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
L30384 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ On the contrary.
L30383 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Is the Emperor angry with me?
L30382 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Because His Majesty wishes it.
L30381 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
L30380 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ What is what?
L30379 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
L30826 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
L30825 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
L30824 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
L30823 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
L30822 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ Mozart -
L30764 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Baron!
L30763 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
L30201 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
L30200 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
L30185 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
L30184 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ I don't think it was really decided, Director.
L31341 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
L31340 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Oh my son, my poor son!
L31339 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
L31338 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
L31337 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ What difference does that make?
L31336 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ But not his body.
L31335 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ I poisoned his life.
L31334 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ No, you didn't!
L31333 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ I did.
L31332 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
L31076 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
L31075 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Yes.
L31074 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
L31073 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ What?
L30474 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
L30473 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
L30472 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
L30471 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ My son, no one can speak for God.
L30470 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
L30469 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
L30468 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ No? Was Mozart a good man?
L30467 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ You cannot say that!
L30466 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
L30342 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
L30341 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Did you try?
L30340 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
L30029 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
L30028 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Do you hear me?
L30026 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Should I?
L30025 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Do you believe it?
L30024 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Is it true?
L30023 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ And do they believe it?
L30022 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ All Vienna has heard that.
L30021 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Ah - you've heard that?
L30020 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
L30019 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
L30018 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
L30017 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
L30016 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ I regret it is not too familiar.
L30015 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Well?
L30013 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
L30012 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ I can't say I do. What is it?
L30011 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Then you must know this.
L30010 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Here in Vienna.
L30009 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Where?
L30008 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
L30007 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ How well are you trained in music?
L30006 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
L30005 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ I do not seek forgiveness.
L30004 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
L30003 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Are they?
L30002 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
L30001 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
L30000 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
L29999 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ Leave me alone.
L29998 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
L29997 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ What do you want?
L29996 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ In the sight of God that is a sin.
L29995 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ So?
L29994 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
L29993 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ About what?
L29992 +++$+++ u266 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VOGLER +++$+++ I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
L29991 +++$+++ u257 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OLD SALIERI +++$+++ What do you want?
L30852 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes, in the third act.
L30851 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
L30850 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
L30849 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Ballet? What ballet?
L30848 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ About the ballet.
L30847 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ What anger?
L30844 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ The Emperor has given him permission.
L30843 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Incredible.
L30842 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
L30794 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Never mind.
L30793 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Where?
L30792 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I've seen the manuscript.
L30791 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Are you absolutely sure?
L30787 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ You must be mad.
L30786 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes.
L30785 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ He's setting that play to music?
L30784 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Exactly.
L30783 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ You mean that play?
L30780 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Italian?
L30779 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
L30778 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Yes?
L30777 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
L30799 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Ah.
L30798 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
L30797 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Oh yes, yes. And that was?
L30796 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
L30795 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
L30183 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Did we?
L30182 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
L30159 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Well done, Sire!
L30158 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Bravo, Your Majesty!
L31180 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
L31179 +++$+++ u259 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ PAPAGENO +++$+++ Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
L31178 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
L31177 +++$+++ u259 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ PAPAGENO +++$+++ What do you mean - now?
L31176 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Well, promise then.
L31175 +++$+++ u259 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ PAPAGENO +++$+++ I can't wait.
L31174 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
L31173 +++$+++ u259 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ PAPAGENO +++$+++ Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
L31172 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
L31171 +++$+++ u259 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ PAPAGENO +++$+++ What? Who the devil are you?
L31170 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Here I am, my angel.
L31050 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
L31049 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
L31048 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
L31047 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
L31046 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I agree, Baron.
L31045 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
L30526 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Come with me. And stay in the room.
L30525 +++$+++ u264 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SERVANT +++$+++ He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
L30524 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What does he want?
L30478 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Show her in. Then go to bed.
L30477 +++$+++ u264 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SERVANT +++$+++ That lady is back, sir.
L30417 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Excuse me, my dear.
L30416 +++$+++ u264 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SERVANT +++$+++ She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
L30415 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Who is she?
L30414 +++$+++ u264 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SERVANT +++$+++ Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
L31226 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
L31225 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
L31223 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
L31222 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ I'll call tomorrow.
L31221 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Bene.
L31220 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
L31219 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Of course.
L31218 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
L31217 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
L31216 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ But he's all right?
L31215 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
L31214 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Can we come in?
L31213 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes, I am looking after him.
L31212 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Herr Salieri.
L31667 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Thank you.
L31666 +++$+++ u280 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ORDERLY +++$+++ I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
L31665 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
L31664 +++$+++ u280 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ORDERLY +++$+++ What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
L31663 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ How did he look?
L31662 +++$+++ u280 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ORDERLY +++$+++ The American? Yes, duck.
L31661 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
L32200 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ I doubt it. But it's something to do.
L32199 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David?
L32198 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
L32135 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Tea would be nice.
L32134 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What shall we do?
L32060 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ I expect you shortly.
L32059 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, a cab will be faster.
L32058 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Shall I send a car?
L32057 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He's fine. We'll come right over.
L32056 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
L32055 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, Doctor.
L32054 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
L32053 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, I should think so.
L32052 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Could you get here without any trouble?
L32051 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, not really.
L32050 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Is David acting strangely?
L32049 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, why?
L32048 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
L32047 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
L32046 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ The zoo? Is he rational?
L32045 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
L32044 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
L32043 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He's here.
L31993 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
L31992 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What shall we do?
L31991 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
L31990 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Dr. Hirsch?
L31989 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
L31988 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Surely you're not suggesting...
L31987 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
L31986 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
L31985 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
L31984 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ And what else?
L31983 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
L31982 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes.
L31981 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
L31980 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
L31979 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Warn him?
L31978 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David says Jack comes to warn him.
L31977 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ What did he say?
L31976 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes.
L31975 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Has his friend appeared to him again?
L31974 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
L31973 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
L31972 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He's not?
L31969 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
L31968 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ It's a full moon. Where is he?
L31967 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L31966 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
L31962 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Come to my office, Miss Price.
L31961 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
L31591 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, I believe he did.
L31590 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Did he say a wolf?
L31557 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
L31556 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
L31555 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What happened to them?
L31554 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
L31553 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He said 'Jack'.
L31552 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ What exactly did he call out?
L31551 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, Doctor?
L31550 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Oh, Miss Price?
L31549 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, Doctor.
L31548 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Go about your duties.
L31547 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Dr. Hirsch?
L31546 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Can I be of service, Miss Price?
L31542 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
L31541 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
L32119 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
L32118 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, don't lose control.
L32117 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
L32116 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, let's go now.
L32115 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Hopeless. It's hopeless.
L32106 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Will you shut up!?!!
L32105 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
L32093 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I swear, I don't know this girl.
L32092 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ We had an argument. He's being silly.
L32091 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What?
L32090 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
L32087 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
L32086 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
L32085 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
L32084 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Jack is dead!
L32083 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
L32082 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, stop!
L32081 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
L32080 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, what are you doing?
L32077 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Pull over.
L32076 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But...
L32065 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
L32064 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
L32063 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I should be committed.
L32062 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The next corner we can get a cab.
L32037 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
L32036 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Don't you remember?
L32035 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
L32034 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The zoo?
L32033 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
L32032 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm freezing.
L32031 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David! Where on earth have you been!?!
L31919 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ See you later.
L31918 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
L31917 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ A doper werewolf.
L31916 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I've left those pills for you.
L31915 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Okay.
L31914 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
L31913 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah, I do, but go to work.
L31912 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
L31911 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Werewolves simply do not exist.
L31910 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
L31909 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
L31908 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Anything.
L31907 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Do me an enormous favor?
L31906 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Let me go now, you'll make me late.
L31852 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
L31851 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Tomorrow is the full moon.
L31850 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I wasn't hallucinating.
L31849 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But, David.
L31848 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I was awake and he was in my room.
L31847 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
L31846 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Good.
L31845 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Of course.
L31844 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
L31843 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes?
L31842 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Alex?
L31841 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's nice to see you.
L31840 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's nice to see you.
L31839 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
L31838 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ There is only one bed.
L31837 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The bedroom.
L31836 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Lovely.
L31835 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Bathroom.
L31834 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Charming.
L31833 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Closet.
L31832 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Very nice.
L31831 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The kitchen.
L31829 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah, I would think so, too.
L31828 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I would think so.
L31827 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I was dreaming again?
L31826 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
L31825 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
L31824 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Your dead friend Jack?
L31823 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ My friend Jack was just here.
L31822 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
L31821 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'll let you know the next full moon.
L31820 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Are you better now?
L31819 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ A werewolf?
L31818 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm a werewolf.
L31758 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
L31757 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Now I'm embarrassed.
L31756 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
L31755 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
L31754 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
L31753 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Not just a patient -- me.
L31752 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
L31751 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Will you think about it?
L31750 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
L31749 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
L31748 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What?
L31747 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Will you come with me?
L31746 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
L31745 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
L31744 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That's easy enough.
L31743 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
L31742 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
L31741 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm sorry I woke you up.
L31740 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Hello. You all right?
L31736 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
L31735 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes, go on.
L31734 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
L31733 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What? Oh, yes, please.
L31732 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Shall I read to you?
L31731 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ My best friend. My very best friend.
L31730 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
L31729 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Now what do you want to talk about?
L31728 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I know.
L31727 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm twenty-seven.
L31726 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Twenty-eight.
L31725 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How old are you?
L31724 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That's not really a very proper question.
L31723 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How old are you?
L31722 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's okay. I want to talk to you.
L31721 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
L31720 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I dream of death mostly.
L31719 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What do you dream about?
L31718 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
L31717 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Do you like it?
L31716 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
L31715 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I was. What are you reading?
L31714 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I thought you were asleep.
L31713 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You're a very beautiful girl.
L31688 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Will you give me a break?
L31687 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Let's try a little harder, shall we?
L31686 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Right.
L31685 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
L31684 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
L31683 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Call me David.
L31682 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
L31681 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Aw come on, Alex!
L31680 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Call me Alex.
L31679 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Aw come on, Miss Price!
L31678 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Sorry.
L31677 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
L31676 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
L31675 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How is that?
L31674 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
L31673 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Please, really. I'm not hungry.
L31672 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm afraid you have to eat something.
L31671 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm not very hungry, thank you.
L31670 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You haven't eaten your lunch.
L31669 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes?
L31668 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Mr. Kessler?
L31589 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ A wolf.
L31588 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What?
L31587 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It was a wolf.
L31586 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L31585 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It wasn't a lunatic.
L31935 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I thought not.
L31934 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No.
L31933 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
L31932 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No!
L31931 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No what?
L31930 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No.
L31929 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ How are we feeling tonight?
L31660 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Right.
L31659 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No.
L31658 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
L31657 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No.
L31656 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Feeling better?
L31655 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No.
L31654 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
L31653 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No.
L31652 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No what?
L31651 +++$+++ u270 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BENJAMIN +++$+++ No.
L31650 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Hello, Benjamin.
L31539 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
L31538 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ I looked.
L31537 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Why on earth do you say that?
L31536 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ I think he's a Jew.
L31535 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Chart says he's from New York.
L31534 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
L31533 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
L31532 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ He all right?
L31649 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
L31648 +++$+++ u279 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MRS. HOBBS +++$+++ Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
L31647 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Has he been refusing food?
L31646 +++$+++ u279 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MRS. HOBBS +++$+++ Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
L31645 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
L31644 +++$+++ u279 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MRS. HOBBS +++$+++ Miss Price.
L32104 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That's what I want you to do, you moron!
L32103 +++$+++ u271 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
L32102 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Who is this girl?
L32099 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
L32098 +++$+++ u271 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ Now see here young man.
L32097 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
L32096 +++$+++ u271 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ There's no call for that kind of language.
L32095 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
L32094 +++$+++ u271 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ All right, you two, move along.
L32089 +++$+++ u271 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ You did, did you?
L32088 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Officer, I killed those people last night.
L32171 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Why are you doing this to me?
L32170 +++$+++ u272 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BRINGSLY +++$+++ No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
L32169 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
L32161 +++$+++ u272 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BRINGSLY +++$+++ You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
L32160 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
L32159 +++$+++ u272 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ BRINGSLY +++$+++ This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
L32158 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
L31475 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ You could have told them!
L31474 +++$+++ u273 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ CHESS PLAYER +++$+++ No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
L31429 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ That's very funny, that is.
L31428 +++$+++ u273 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ CHESS PLAYER +++$+++ Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
L31421 +++$+++ u273 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ CHESS PLAYER +++$+++ No. You've had your chance.
L31420 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, come on, tell us.
L31419 +++$+++ u273 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ CHESS PLAYER +++$+++ All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
L31418 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
L31417 +++$+++ u273 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ CHESS PLAYER +++$+++ You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
L31416 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ No, but we're about to.
L31415 +++$+++ u273 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ CHESS PLAYER +++$+++ Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
L31642 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ Bambi?
L31641 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
L31640 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ Some, everyone does.
L31639 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Do you have bad dreams, too?
L31638 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
L31637 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What are you going to see?
L31636 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
L31635 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Alex?
L31634 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
L31633 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What time is it?
L31632 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
L31630 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I was having a nightmare.
L31629 +++$+++ u278 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ MISS GALLAGHER +++$+++ Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
L31712 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
L31711 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
L31709 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
L31708 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
L31707 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
L31706 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
L31705 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ I really don't know.
L31704 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
L31703 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
L31702 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Did you see Jack?
L31701 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
L31700 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
L31699 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Yes.
L31698 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
L31697 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
L31696 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
L31695 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ You've never had bad dreams before?
L31628 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
L31627 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
L31626 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
L31625 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ So they said.
L31624 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ There were witnesses?
L31584 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
L31583 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Lunatic?
L31582 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
L31581 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Two weeks?
L31580 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
L31579 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How long have I been here?
L31573 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
L31572 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
L31564 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
L31563 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
L31562 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
L31561 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
L31560 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ You're in a hospital in London.
L31559 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Where am I?
L31558 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
L32177 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
L32176 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I could hang myself.
L32173 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How shall I do it?
L32172 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Because this must be stopped.
L32156 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
L32155 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Hello.
L32154 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
L32153 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I want you to meet some people.
L32152 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
L32151 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What about the zoo?
L32150 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
L32149 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Thank you.
L32148 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You look awful.
L32147 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ If I was still alive, I probably would.
L32146 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
L32145 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You don't have to say anything.
L32144 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What can I say, Jack?
L32143 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hi, David.
L32142 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Hi, Jack.
L31874 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I will not accept this! Now go away!
L31873 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
L31872 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
L31871 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You must believe me.
L31870 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
L31869 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What do you think?
L31868 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Jack, are you really dead?
L31867 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
L31866 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ A monster. I know, I know.
L31865 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
L31864 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Get out of here, Jack!
L31863 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yes.
L31862 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
L31861 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
L31860 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
L31859 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I wanted to see you.
L31858 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L31857 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
L31856 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You're not real.
L31812 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
L31811 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
L31810 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
L31809 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Nurse!
L31808 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
L31807 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Nurse!
L31806 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
L31805 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
L31804 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
L31803 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Jack, please go away. Please go away.
L31802 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
L31801 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Stop it, Jack.
L31800 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
L31799 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
L31798 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
L31797 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What?!
L31796 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's you, David.
L31795 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Will you be quiet?!
L31794 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
L31793 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What's wrong with you? Shut up!
L31792 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
L31791 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Shut up, you zombie!
L31790 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
L31789 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm not listening!
L31788 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We were attacked by a werewolf.
L31787 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
L31786 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
L31785 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
L31784 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
L31783 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What?!
L31782 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ David!
L31781 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm going completely crazy.
L31780 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Life mocks me even in death.
L31779 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Rudy Levine the shmuck?
L31778 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
L31777 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I can't stand it.
L31776 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Debbie Klein cried a lot.
L31775 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
L31774 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
L31773 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
L31772 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
L31771 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
L31770 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ David! You're hurting my feelings.
L31769 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
L31768 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ This is too much. I can't handle this.
L31767 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Thanks a lot.
L31766 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
L31765 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nice to see you.
L31525 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Are you going to help me up?
L31524 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You really scared me, you shithead.
L31523 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
L31522 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'll tell you when we get there.
L31521 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Where are we going?
L31520 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.
L31519 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Jack?
L31518 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Not far enough. Come on.
L31517 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It sounds far away.
L31516 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No.
L31515 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ See anything?
L31514 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
L31513 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Walk away, Jack.
L31512 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nice doggie. Good boy.
L31511 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
L31510 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh shit. What is that?
L31509 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Do you think it's a dog?
L31508 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's in front of us.
L31506 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Let's just keep walking.
L31505 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Plan?
L31504 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What's the plan?
L31502 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's circling us.
L31501 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's moving.
L31500 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
L31499 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Come on, where?
L31498 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't know. Come on.
L31497 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Shit! David, what is that?
L31495 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah.
L31494 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
L31493 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
L31492 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No, but he was on the moors.
L31491 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Heathcliffe didn't howl.
L31490 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Heathcliffe.
L31489 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Pecos Bill.
L31488 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ The Hound of the Baskervilles.
L31487 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ There aren't any coyotes in England.
L31486 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ A coyote.
L31485 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah?
L31484 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Could be a lot of things.
L31483 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What was it?
L31482 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I heard that.
L31481 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Did you hear that?
L31471 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
L31470 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Say, David...
L31467 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
L31466 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
L31465 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I have no idea.
L31464 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What do you think was wrong?
L31463 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
L31462 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
L31461 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
L31456 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Come on, I'm freezing.
L31455 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Beware the moon?
L31454 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
L31453 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What the hell was that all about?
L31444 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Apparently so.
L31443 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
L31441 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What do you mean? I'm starving.
L31440 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Jack, we'd better go.
L31431 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You ask them.
L31430 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Go on, ask them.
L31427 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Wrong.
L31426 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Right.
L31425 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
L31424 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
L31423 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You ask them.
L31422 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Ask them what the candles are for.
L31406 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Maybe the owners are from Texas.
L31405 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's a five-pointed star.
L31404 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What about it?
L31403 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Look at that.
L31402 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Listen, at least it's warm in here.
L31401 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nice looking group.
L31388 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nice to see you.
L31387 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Hello.
L31386 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Shall we?
L31385 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Okay.
L31384 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I assume full responsibility.
L31383 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
L31382 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
L31381 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That's not a spear. It's a pike.
L31380 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
L31379 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That's a wolf's head.
L31378 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
L31377 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The Slaughtered Lamb?
L31376 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She says she 'likes me too much'.
L31375 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
L31374 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
L31373 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
L31372 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
L31371 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
L31370 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
L31369 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't know.
L31368 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
L31367 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
L31366 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're talking about the woman I love.
L31365 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ She's a jerk.
L31364 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
L31363 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
L31362 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
L31361 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Right.
L31360 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
L31359 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Well, I like it here.
L31358 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
L31357 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You're not having a good time are you?
L31356 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ David.
L31355 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Jack.
L31354 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Good.
L31353 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes.
L31352 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Are you cold?
L32131 +++$+++ u277 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ LT. VILLIERS +++$+++ Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
L32130 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ What can we do to assist you?
L32123 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
L32122 +++$+++ u277 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ LT. VILLIERS +++$+++ The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
L31614 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Why don't we ask him?
L31613 +++$+++ u277 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ LT. VILLIERS +++$+++ Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
L31612 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ You were saying?
L31603 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
L31602 +++$+++ u277 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ LT. VILLIERS +++$+++ No, thank you, Doctor.
L31597 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
L31596 +++$+++ u277 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ LT. VILLIERS +++$+++ Dr. Hirsch?
L31611 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
L31610 +++$+++ u281 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ He's on the telephone.
L31609 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ What here?
L31608 +++$+++ u281 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Roger Mathison, Doctor.
L31607 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Excuse me.  Yes?
L31595 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Send them in.
L31594 +++$+++ u281 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
L31593 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Yes?
L31896 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
L31895 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
L31894 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ What's that?
L31884 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ I suppose Guinness will suffice.
L31883 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Sorry, love.
L31882 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Campari and soda would do nicely.
L31881 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Hello, there. What can I get you?
L31408 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L31407 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Remember the Alamo?
L31399 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
L31398 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh.
L31397 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ No.
L31396 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Then you have some hot tea?
L31395 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
L31394 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hot chocolate?
L31391 +++$+++ u283 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ No.
L31390 +++$+++ u276 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Do you have any hot soup?
L32133 +++$+++ u282 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ SGT. MCMANUS +++$+++ We'll find him, not to worry.
L32132 +++$+++ u277 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ LT. VILLIERS +++$+++ I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
L31622 +++$+++ u277 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ LT. VILLIERS +++$+++ That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
L31621 +++$+++ u282 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ SGT. MCMANUS +++$+++ I don't rightly know, sir.
L31620 +++$+++ u277 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ LT. VILLIERS +++$+++ And what, Sergeant?
L31619 +++$+++ u282 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ SGT. MCMANUS +++$+++ Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
L31618 +++$+++ u277 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ LT. VILLIERS +++$+++ Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
L31617 +++$+++ u282 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ SGT. MCMANUS +++$+++ He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
L31606 +++$+++ u277 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ LT. VILLIERS +++$+++ Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
L31605 +++$+++ u282 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ SGT. MCMANUS +++$+++ Sorry.
L31599 +++$+++ u282 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ SGT. MCMANUS +++$+++ I'd like some tea, please.
L31598 +++$+++ u277 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ LT. VILLIERS +++$+++ No, thank you.
L34791 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Yeah - sure!
L34790 +++$+++ u284 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yes - sure׊L34789 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
L34788 +++$+++ u284 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Why not?
L34787 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
L34786 +++$+++ u284 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
L34760 +++$+++ u284 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ But listen, Tom, I׊L34759 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
L34758 +++$+++ u284 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest׊L34750 +++$+++ u284 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I want to know why .
L34749 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
L34748 +++$+++ u284 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
L34747 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ You here again? What do you want?
L34746 +++$+++ u284 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Hello, Tom.
L35130 +++$+++ u303 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ Yeah.
L35129 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ He has?
L35128 +++$+++ u303 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
L35127 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
L35126 +++$+++ u303 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ Matt?
L35125 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Where's Matt?
L35124 +++$+++ u303 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
L35123 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No kidding?
L35122 +++$+++ u303 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
L35121 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oscar, what's the matter?
L35050 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
L35049 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
L35048 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L35047 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I remember once when your account checked.
L35046 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
L35045 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ What's the matter, Charlie?
L35044 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
L35043 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Where you been?
L34640 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Aw, nerts!
L34639 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
L34638 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
L34637 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Whose death?
L34635 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
L34634 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I׊L34633 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah?
L34632 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Charlie!
L34631 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
L34630 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Let me have ten bucks?
L34629 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L34628 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
L34627 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Here's twenty-five thousand.
L34626 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L34625 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ It was more than that last week.
L34624 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ About twenty-four thousand.
L34623 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ How much?
L34622 +++$+++ u285 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
L34664 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L34663 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ And tell him not to delay.
L34662 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L34661 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
L34660 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Not yet, Mr. Clark.
L34659 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Mr. Dickson in yet?
L35356 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
L35355 +++$+++ u302 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
L34825 +++$+++ u302 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Take it easy, Clark.
L34824 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
L34679 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
L34678 +++$+++ u302 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ What good will that do?
L34677 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust׊L34676 +++$+++ u302 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
L34674 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
L34673 +++$+++ u302 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
L35540 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
L35539 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ We've been waiting fifteen minutes׊L35538 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
L35483 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
L35482 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
L35344 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
L35343 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Say, you can't do that׊L35340 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
L35339 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
L35338 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
L35337 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
L35334 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
L35333 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
L35332 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
L35331 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ What do you mean, help?
L35330 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
L35257 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ We'll discuss that in the board room.
L35256 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ What about?
L35255 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ We want to talk to you.
L34922 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
L34921 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
L34920 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
L34913 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
L34912 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
L34845 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
L34844 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
L34830 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Just pure luck!
L34829 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
L34799 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
L34798 +++$+++ u286 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
L34797 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything׊L35455 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she׊L35454 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
L35453 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
L35452 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
L35451 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
L35449 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
L35448 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
L35431 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
L35430 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
L35429 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ All right, Jack, all right.
L35428 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
L35412 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings "Mother Machree" whenever he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time.
L35411 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
L35410 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Thanks.
L35407 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Why, of course.
L35406 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ You understand?
L35405 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Oh!
L35404 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
L35403 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
L35402 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
L35401 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
L35400 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ That's very simple. I was home.
L35399 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
L35398 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
L35397 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
L35473 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Get out, get out!
L35472 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't׊L35461 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
L35460 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
L35459 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
L35458 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
L35444 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
L35443 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Fifty thousand dollars!
L35442 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
L35441 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
L35440 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
L35439 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
L34883 +++$+++ u289 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
L34882 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
L34881 +++$+++ u289 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?

L34878 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
L34864 +++$+++ u289 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
L34863 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ What do you mean?
L34862 +++$+++ u289 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ You don't have to do nothing.
L34861 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
L34860 +++$+++ u289 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ Why not?

L34852 +++$+++ u289 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ That don't do us any good.

L34849 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ I haven't got it.
L34848 +++$+++ u289 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
L34847 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
L34846 +++$+++ u289 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DUDE +++$+++ You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
L35079 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L35078 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Why, Matt!
L35077 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
L35076 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
L35075 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
L35074 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ A misunderstood bachelor.
L35073 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
L35072 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
L35071 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
L35070 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Good for you. Come on.
L35069 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important dealsנ I think I will have a drink.
L35068 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
L35067 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
L35066 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
L35065 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.

L34949 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer׊L34948 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS.

L34939 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
L34938 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.

L34936 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.

L34929 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
L34911 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ See, we're getting along famously!
L34910 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
L34909 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Doesn't that come next?
L34907 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
L34906 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
L34905 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
L34904 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
L34903 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Line?
L34902 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
L34901 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
L34900 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ زunning around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
L34899 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ What is?
L34898 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks׊L34897 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
L34896 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Well, you can. You always could.
L34895 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
L34894 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
L34893 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Me?
L34892 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
L34891 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ What is the matter with you? You're trembling?

L35101 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
L35100 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
L35099 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
L35098 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
L35096 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
L35095 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
L35094 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
L35093 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ I'm not interested in what you think.
L35089 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
L35088 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
L35086 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.  You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone.
L35085 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ I'm listening.
L35084 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
L35081 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
L35080 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
L35055 +++$+++ u287 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ CLUETT +++$+++ Yes, now.
L35054 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Now?

L35468 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
L35012 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ No.
L35011 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Happy now?
L35010 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
L35006 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Tomorrow night?
L35005 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
L35004 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Well . . .

L35002 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
L35001 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Ho! Ho! Ho!
L35000 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
L34999 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn׊L34998 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Yes, of course.
L34997 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
L34996 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ The theatre?
L34995 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
L34994 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
L34993 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
L34992 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
L34991 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.

L34989 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
L34988 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
L34987 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ What's the matter dear? What have I done now?

First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife.

L34957 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ It's all right. Thanks.
L35464 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
L35463 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
L35462 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ You're lying!
L35457 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
L35456 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ My wife? What's she got to do with you?
L35438 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
L35437 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
L35436 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
L35298 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
L35297 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Of course it's true - and he knows it.
L35241 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they׊L35240 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
L35239 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
L35238 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
L35175 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
L35174 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
L35171 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
L35170 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ If he can do it, yes.
L35169 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
L35168 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
L35167 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ What time did this thing happen?
L35159 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Yes.
L35158 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
L35157 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Why pick on him ?
L35156 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
L35155 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
L35348 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
L35347 +++$+++ u304 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L35346 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
L35345 +++$+++ u304 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
L35327 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Don't you think I know it?
L35326 +++$+++ u304 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
L35317 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
L35316 +++$+++ u304 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ What'll we do?
L35315 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
L35314 +++$+++ u304 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
L35313 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Mine too?
L35312 +++$+++ u304 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L35311 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Did you get the case for the securities?
L35310 +++$+++ u304 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
L35253 +++$+++ u304 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L35252 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
L35251 +++$+++ u304 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
L35250 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
L35249 +++$+++ u304 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
L35247 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L35246 +++$+++ u304 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ The lobby's half filled now.
L35026 +++$+++ u304 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L35025 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
L35024 +++$+++ u304 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ He says he can't get away in the daytime.
L35023 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
L35022 +++$+++ u304 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ I'm afraid he's been stalling.
L35021 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
L35020 +++$+++ u304 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
L35019 +++$+++ u288 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ DICKSON +++$+++ Well, Sampson, what is it?
L35395 +++$+++ u291 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
L35394 +++$+++ u296 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ LADY +++$+++ But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
L35393 +++$+++ u291 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
L34809 +++$+++ u296 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ LADY +++$+++ It's his life insurance money, you know.
L34808 +++$+++ u291 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Absolutely.
L34807 +++$+++ u296 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ LADY +++$+++ Is it safe?
L34806 +++$+++ u291 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
L34877 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ All right.
L34876 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
L34875 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Hardly.
L34874 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
L34873 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ No.
L34872 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
L34871 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I'm afraid so.
L34870 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
L34869 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He's at a board meeting.
L34868 +++$+++ u299 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. DICKSON +++$+++ Is that busy husband of mine busy?
L34867 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
L35523 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
L35522 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
L35521 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Mr. Williams . . .
L35520 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
L35507 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
L35506 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Did you talk to him?
L35493 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
L35492 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
L35491 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ They must have turned him down.
L35490 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
L35489 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
L35369 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
L35368 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh, Matt . . .
L35042 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ All right, dear.
L35041 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
L35040 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that׊L35039 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
L35038 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
L35037 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh now, don't be silly.
L35036 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
L35035 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
L35034 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Oh, Charlie again.
L35033 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What's keeping you?
L34981 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
L34980 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ In Cluett's office?
L34979 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I tell you, I saw them!
L34978 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
L34977 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Well, he was making love to her.
L34976 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Well . . . ?
L34975 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
L34974 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
L34973 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Yeah.
L34972 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
L34955 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Yeah, swell.
L34954 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
L34704 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh, Matt.
L34703 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
L34702 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes.
L34701 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Oh, you think I'm lying?
L34700 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ No.
L34699 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
L34698 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes.
L34697 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Oh, ten dollars׊L34696 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ The ten dollars.
L34695 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ With what?
L34694 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What did you do with it?
L34651 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh, is that so?
L34650 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
L34649 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Come here, honey!
L34648 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Why?
L34647 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Matt, come here!
L34646 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Hello, Helen!
L35385 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L35384 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Are you sure?
L35383 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He came to see Mr. Cluett.
L35382 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ He was here?
L35381 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He was in the bank yesterday.
L35380 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Yes, why?
L35379 +++$+++ u292 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Did you say Dude Finlay?
L35376 +++$+++ u298 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L35375 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Dude Finlay?
L35374 +++$+++ u298 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
L35373 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Never mind all that. What did you find out?
L35372 +++$+++ u298 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
L35371 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ What did you find out, Mike?
L35294 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.

L35289 +++$+++ u300 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
L35288 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
L35287 +++$+++ u300 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ No. It wasn't earlier because...
L35286 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ It couldn't have been earlier?
L35285 +++$+++ u300 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
L35282 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Was it twelve o'clock?
L35281 +++$+++ u300 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
L35280 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
L35279 +++$+++ u300 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after׊L35278 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ What time did Matt Brown get in?
L35277 +++$+++ u300 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ Huh?
L35276 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ What time was it?
L35275 +++$+++ u300 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MRS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.
L35274 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?

L35301 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Then where were you?

L35140 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
L35139 +++$+++ u297 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ wasn't anywhere near this place׊L35138 +++$+++ u294 +++$+++ m18 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?

L36303 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ Sometimes a wound will kill.
L36302 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ This is healing?
L35843 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Jim Younger, I told you--
L35842 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ I couldn't lose him.
L35692 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
L35691 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ I think I may just go on to the reservation.
L35643 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
L35642 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You can ride like that?
L36521 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ It's tougher than it looks.
L36520 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ He's not bad at it.
L36519 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
L36427 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
L36426 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I'm sorry, Cole.
L36424 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Swear on Jimmy's grave.
L36423 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I swear --
L36422 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Swear.
L36421 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Bob. I didn't...
L36420 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
L36419 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I ain't done --
L36418 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ What have you done?
L36417 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ How'd they --
L36399 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Leave me alone, Bob.
L36398 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
L36397 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
L36396 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
L36395 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
L36394 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ This is the best score yet.
L36292 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ What?
L36291 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
L36177 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
L36176 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ We got a problem here, brother?
L36132 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.
L36131 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ How?
L36130 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
L36043 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You stay out of this, Bob.
L36042 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Uhh, yeah it does.
L36034 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
L36033 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
L35966 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
L35965 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
L35964 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
L35920 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Zee, I'm pleased you came.
L35919 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
L35747 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ That was two hours ago.
L35746 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
L35663 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
L35662 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
L35622 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Never a good thing.
L35621 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ He's smiling.
L35590 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
L35589 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
L35836 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Tomorrow.
L35835 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The Army can hang him.
L35834 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
L35833 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Damn!
L35830 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ He just lost his temper a little.
L35829 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Oh no...
L35828 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
L35690 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
L35689 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
L35681 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ ... Will Perry ...
L35680 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
L35668 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Then I love it.
L35667 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Nope.
L35666 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Corn gonna shoot at me?
L35656 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
L35655 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yesterday.
L35619 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
L35618 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
L36276 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Tell me.
L36275 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
L36274 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What?
L36273 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ He's planning a job.
L36272 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ He's been full of vinegar lately.
L36271 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
L36270 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You are a fine figure of a man.
L36269 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
L36179 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
L36178 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
L36173 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
L36172 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Beg pardon?
L36171 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
L36170 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
L36068 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ "Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."
L36067 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Hey!
L36066 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ "The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
L36037 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
L36036 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
L36035 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
L35973 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Exactly.
L35972 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ But if we take their money and supplies...
L35924 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Not yet. But I'm hoping.
L35923 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You have no shame.
L35832 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Two.
L35831 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ How many of them did he kill?
L35659 +++$+++ u306 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Best damn plan I heard all war.
L35658 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
L36486 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
L36485 +++$+++ u307 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BURLY DETECTIVE +++$+++ You shut up now, boy.
L36484 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
L36483 +++$+++ u307 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BURLY DETECTIVE +++$+++ How?
L36482 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I think I recognize you.
L36481 +++$+++ u307 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BURLY DETECTIVE +++$+++ What you sayin' boy?
L36480 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
L36479 +++$+++ u307 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ BURLY DETECTIVE +++$+++ What?
L36523 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
L36522 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Where'd you get all these riders?
L36518 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
L36517 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
L36516 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Missed you too, cousin.
L36515 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Missed you, cousin.
L36353 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
L36352 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
L36351 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I'm out.
L36350 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ We'll make them pay for this.
L36335 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Pass me some whisky.
L36334 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Bob, rip up some bandages.
L36331 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
L36330 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Okay, you're gonna rest here.
L36320 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ A trap.
L36319 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Dammit!
L36314 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
L36313 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Fine. We hit this bank.
L36312 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Then let me run the show, General Lee.
L36311 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Still smells fishy.
L36307 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ And I'm the better outlaw.
L36306 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
L36300 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ That's it.
L36299 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ And almost got hanged in peacetime.
L36298 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I got us through the War all right.
L36297 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ A bad idea.
L36296 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
L36295 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Beautiful.
L36284 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You're forgetting who's in charge --
L36283 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
L36282 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What are you saying?
L36281 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
L36280 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
L36278 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What will be?
L36277 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ It'll be the biggest score yet.
L36181 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
L36180 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
L36127 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
L36126 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Yep.
L36125 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
L36124 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Sure, cousin.
L36123 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Jesse, we got to have a word.
L36063 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Twenty?!
L36062 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ "The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
L36057 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
L36056 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ It's not a bank.
L36041 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
L36040 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ See, Frank's being smart about this.
L36030 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I got three.
L36029 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I got seven thousand.
L36001 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Don't let it happen again.
L36000 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Sorry.
L35999 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ The James-Younger Gang.
L35979 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Let's ride.
L35978 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Perfect, Cole.
L35977 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
L35971 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
L35970 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ So what do we do, General Lee?
L35969 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
L35776 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Yeah.
L35775 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
L35774 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
L35773 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ It was exciting.
L35772 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
L35771 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
L35770 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Thanks for the help.
L35763 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
L35762 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ She was European!
L35761 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ She had a moustache.
L35754 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ She got two of them.
L35753 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
L35688 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
L35687 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ What is wrong with you?
L35686 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Not now.
L35678 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
L35677 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You're not scared, are you?
L35676 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Hands off your hip, Cole.
L35665 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
L35664 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Home, boys. Back to our farms.
L35653 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
L35652 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Where you boys going?
L35646 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
L35645 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I could use the walk.
L35644 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Ride with me, cousin?
L35615 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What's going on?
L35614 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ 'Bout time you got here, buddy.
L35672 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ I'm thinking...
L35671 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Well?
L35670 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
L35669 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
L35641 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ You ride like a Comanche.
L35640 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
L35596 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
L35595 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
L36323 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ They're just insurance in case we run.
L36322 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ They gonna rush us?
L36321 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Another dozen out back.
L36287 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Cole, he didn't mean that.
L36286 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
L36285 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Jesse.
L36053 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ -- Exactly. Because this is a war.
L36052 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Strategically.
L36051 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
L35947 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Get buckets!
L35946 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
L35768 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Ah.
L35767 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Shakespeare.  He's European.
L35766 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
L35760 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Sadie was not a man!
L35759 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
L35757 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The brown one.
L35756 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Which one, right or left?
L35755 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I think one of 'em's glass.
L35675 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
L35674 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ What the --
L35609 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
L35608 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Both would be nice.
L35607 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Cannon or Gatling?
L36393 +++$+++ u325 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ TELLER +++$+++ All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
L36392 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
L36389 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ This here is the Younger Gang!
L36388 +++$+++ u325 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ TELLER +++$+++ Where is Jesse James?
L36387 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ What?
L36386 +++$+++ u325 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ TELLER +++$+++ Of course!  Uh, sir?
L36385 +++$+++ u308 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ The safe. Now.
L36147 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ Me get heap firewater --
L36146 +++$+++ u318 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
L36144 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ Ho-yah!
L36143 +++$+++ u318 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
L36142 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
L36141 +++$+++ u318 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Of St. Louis?
L36140 +++$+++ u318 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ The District Marshall
L36139 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
L36138 +++$+++ u318 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
L36137 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ You 'um big lawman?
L36015 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ I'd appreciate that.
L36014 +++$+++ u319 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Fine. I'll just wait here.
L36013 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ It's a secret.
L36012 +++$+++ u319 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
L36011 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ On account of we're robbing it.
L36010 +++$+++ u319 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Then why can't I go in there?
L36009 +++$+++ u309 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ COMANCHE TOM +++$+++ You're right, sir.
L36008 +++$+++ u319 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
L36028 +++$+++ u324 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ SHERRIFF +++$+++ Shit.
L36027 +++$+++ u310 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ I had you covered.  From back there.
L36026 +++$+++ u324 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ SHERRIFF +++$+++ Where the hell were you?
L36020 +++$+++ u324 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ SHERRIFF +++$+++ When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
L36019 +++$+++ u310 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ So?
L36018 +++$+++ u324 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ SHERRIFF +++$+++ Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
L36017 +++$+++ u310 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ DEPUTY +++$+++ What is it?
L36016 +++$+++ u324 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ SHERRIFF +++$+++ What the --
L35915 +++$+++ u311 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ DOC MIMMS +++$+++ It's fine by me, Jesse.
L35914 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
L35913 +++$+++ u311 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ DOC MIMMS +++$+++ You know you're welcome any time!
L35910 +++$+++ u311 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ DOC MIMMS +++$+++ Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
L35909 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What do you say, sir?
L35841 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
L35840 +++$+++ u311 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ DOC MIMMS +++$+++ Boys...
L35710 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Died a hero.
L35709 +++$+++ u311 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ DOC MIMMS +++$+++ Web died fighting?
L35706 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
L35705 +++$+++ u311 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ DOC MIMMS +++$+++ My little Web did that?
L35704 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ -- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
L36104 +++$+++ u311 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ DOC MIMMS +++$+++ I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
L36103 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ He thinks this is some kind of game!
L35877 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ I think he's already feeling better.
L35876 +++$+++ u311 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ DOC MIMMS +++$+++ Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
L35875 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
L35874 +++$+++ u311 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ DOC MIMMS +++$+++ They're gone. What are you --
L35863 +++$+++ u311 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ DOC MIMMS +++$+++ The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
L35862 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
L35717 +++$+++ u311 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ DOC MIMMS +++$+++ Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
L35716 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Daddy, don't start with this again.
L36529 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
L36528 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
L36527 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
L36349 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
L36348 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
L36347 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah.
L36346 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
L36345 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
L36344 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
L36343 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Jim was old enough...
L36342 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
L36326 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Got any ideas, little brother?
L36325 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
L36289 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No, I --
L36288 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
L36212 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
L36211 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Oh yeah.
L36210 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We're drunk.
L36206 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
L36205 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
L36204 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Maybe it started out that way. But now...
L36203 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ We're doing this for Ma.
L36202 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
L36201 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
L36200 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ If I could go back to farming --
L36199 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You've killed your fair share of men.
L36198 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
L36197 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ And we're good at it.
L36196 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Jesse, we're outlaws.
L36195 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ This has been a good year.
L36188 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
L36187 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
L36184 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The posters?
L36183 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Bob's upset.
L36182 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
L36112 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
L36111 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
L36059 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
L36058 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
L36047 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
L36046 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
L36023 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We're gonna have to talk...
L36022 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Fine. How'd it go out here?
L36021 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How'd it go in there?
L35963 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
L35962 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
L35961 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Don't care.
L35960 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ ... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
L35949 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Ma.
L35948 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
L35912 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
L35911 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
L35908 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
L35907 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What do you think?
L35906 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
L35811 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Damn. All that reading paid off.
L35810 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
L35784 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Heard of him.
L35783 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You know him?
L35765 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
L35764 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ -- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
L35752 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
L35751 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She's still talking to Jesus.
L35735 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Next time try "fat and haggard."
L35734 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
L35733 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You are a charmer.
L35732 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You can shut up now.
L35731 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ "Big and older"?
L35725 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Maybe, maybe...
L35724 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ That just might work.
L35722 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What kind of story are they going to believe?
L35721 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
L35720 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
L35708 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
L35707 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
L35702 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
L35701 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You're doing just fine.
L35700 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Frank, don't you have something to say?
L35684 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
L35683 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
L35661 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
L35660 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hello, Liberty Missoura!
L35651 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
L35650 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Hell of a war.
L35649 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I reckoned.
L35648 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Web's dead.
L35639 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
L35638 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
L35637 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I figure.
L35636 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ That would have made an impression.
L35635 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
L35634 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Such as?
L35633 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mm-hmm.
L35632 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
L35631 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
L35630 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Distracting enough for you?
L35617 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ So we got a plan?
L35616 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
L36550 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Everything but the boring parts.
L36549 +++$+++ u315 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ How much of that story is true?
L36548 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah Jimmy?
L36547 +++$+++ u315 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Uncle Frank?
L36545 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
L36544 +++$+++ u315 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ So what was he?
L36543 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Can't argue that.
L36542 +++$+++ u315 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ But he killed a lot of men, too.
L36541 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
L36540 +++$+++ u315 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ They're making him a hero now.
L36539 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That he was.
L36538 +++$+++ u315 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
L36537 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
L36536 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
L36535 +++$+++ u315 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ ...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
L36534 +++$+++ u312 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah, Jimmy?
L36533 +++$+++ u315 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Y'know, Uncle Frank...
L35958 +++$+++ u317 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Shush.
L35957 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Doc Mimms will --
L35956 +++$+++ u317 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
L35955 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
L35954 +++$+++ u317 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Riders --
L35952 +++$+++ u317 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Boys?
L35951 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Ma! Please!
L35804 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
L35803 +++$+++ u317 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
L35780 +++$+++ u317 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ We're just fine, thank you, sir.
L35779 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Easterners.
L35750 +++$+++ u317 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
L35749 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
L35741 +++$+++ u317 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Say your prayers?
L35740 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ A fair number, Ma.
L35739 +++$+++ u317 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Did you kill Yankees?
L36532 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I'll explain on the way.
L36531 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Tennessee?
L36514 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Yes ma'am.
L36513 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Don't swear.
L36512 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You are a hell of a woman.
L36511 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
L36510 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Yes ma'am.
L36509 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
L36414 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ If you don't see it, it's not real...
L36413 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What?
L36412 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Don't turn around.
L36411 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Swimming. Swimming is good.
L36410 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Stop it. This is just sad.
L36409 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Aw, shucks, ma'am...
L36408 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
L36407 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
L36406 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
L36405 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Let me see that.
L36404 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ "Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
L36403 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L36402 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ "But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
L36401 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ "Hmm" what?
L36400 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Hmm.
L36370 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
L36369 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
L36368 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
L36367 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
L36366 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
L36364 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
L36363 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
L36362 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
L36361 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ I don't understand.
L36360 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I had to see you. I'm getting married.
L36359 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
L36358 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Zee.
L35987 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
L35986 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
L35985 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
L35984 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Let the law --
L35983 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Me neither.
L35982 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
L35981 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Frank and me have to go away for a while.
L35980 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ I am so sorry, Jesse.
L35945 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
L35944 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
L35943 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Yep.
L35942 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
L35941 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Little ones.
L35940 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Sparkling rocks?
L35939 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
L35937 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
L35936 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Where will you find such a girl?
L35935 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
L35934 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ And what's this right girl like?
L35933 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Not if I find the right girl.
L35932 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
L35931 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
L35930 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
L35929 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
L35928 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ A river pirate.
L35927 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
L35926 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ You didn't want to farm?
L35925 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
L35905 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Unfair. You are completely unfair.
L35904 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
L35903 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
L35902 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
L35901 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What?
L35900 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ I shouldn't tease a hero.
L35899 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
L35898 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Teasing you is completely unfair.
L35897 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ No! I mean, of course not. No.
L35896 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ You're sick of my company?
L35895 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
L35894 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ You shouldn't be up.
L35873 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Nuh-huh ...
L35872 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Jesse, is that your hand?
L35871 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Mmmm.
L35870 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Jesse, are you awake?
L35712 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
L35711 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ But still died.
L35697 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ But you got big!
L35696 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ You were little Jesse James when you left.
L35695 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
L36508 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Fair enough.
L36507 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
L36506 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Thanks.
L36505 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
L36499 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
L36498 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
L36457 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
L36456 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Ahh, you'll miss me.
L36455 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ You cocky little bastard.
L36454 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I'm not hanged yet.
L36453 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ That's what I would have done.
L36452 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
L36451 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Was it worth it?
L36450 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I figured.
L36449 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
L36448 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
L36447 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
L36446 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
L36445 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Damn.
L36444 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
L36443 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Yes?
L36442 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
L36441 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Mmm.
L36440 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Last February?
L36439 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
L36438 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Pity.
L36437 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You almost ended my career before it began.
L36435 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
L36434 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Did you order our houses burned down?
L36433 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ That's the idea.
L36432 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
L36431 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
L36430 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ But I like the presidential suite.
L36429 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ We're moving you tomorrow.
L36383 +++$+++ u321 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PASTOR +++$+++ Communion.
L36382 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Right here in church?
L36381 +++$+++ u321 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PASTOR +++$+++ Now let's have a drink.
L36380 +++$+++ u321 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PASTOR +++$+++ Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
L36379 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Thank you.
L36378 +++$+++ u321 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PASTOR +++$+++ Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
L36377 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
L36376 +++$+++ u321 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PASTOR +++$+++ The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
L36375 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You don't think God'll mind, do you?
L36374 +++$+++ u321 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PASTOR +++$+++ This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
L36339 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
L36338 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
L36337 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ This time we'll make an exception.
L36336 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ ... too young for whisky...
L36310 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
L36309 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What about that Rock Island bastard?
L36227 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You do that.
L36226 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
L36225 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I swear.
L36224 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
L36223 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I think so.
L36222 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
L36221 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You been with a girl ever?
L36220 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, not exactly.
L36219 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
L36218 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Jim, you been with a girl yet?
L36217 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
L36216 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I guess so.
L36215 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
L36214 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
L36213 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You okay, Jesse?
L35968 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ No.
L35967 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I like that.
L35848 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ And the same age Web was. No.
L35847 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
L35846 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ And you're too young.
L36245 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Don't talk about it much, though.
L36244 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Really?
L36243 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
L36242 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ That is so gentlemanly of you.
L36241 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
L36240 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
L36239 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
L36238 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Lyla Devereux.
L36237 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Thank you, Miss -- ?
L36236 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I just though you were awful cute.
L36235 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Not at all.
L36234 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I hope I'm not being too forward.
L36233 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Really?
L36232 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
L36231 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
L36230 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
L36229 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why, yeah.
L36496 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Move you fools!
L36495 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ There's only four of them...
L36158 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
L36157 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ How can that be?
L36090 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ By burning down their homes?
L36089 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ They had to be dealt with!
L36088 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
L35858 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
L35857 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
L35795 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ I'm doing you folks a favor --
L35794 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Well, this land is about to be condemned.
L36462 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
L36461 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ How did you know?
L36459 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ I remember you.
L36458 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ This is him.
L36253 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
L36252 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ That.
L36251 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ What, sir?
L36250 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ What is that?
L36249 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Sir?
L36248 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ Parker.
L36247 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ I look forward to seeing it.
L36246 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ The final route for the railroad is complete.
L36160 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
L36159 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ With my money!
L36087 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ What is going on here, man?
L36086 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Your men knew the risks.
L36081 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ We did.
L36080 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ THEN WHO DID?!
L36079 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
L36078 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
L36077 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
L36076 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ How much did they get from the safe?
L36075 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
L35893 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
L35892 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
L35891 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
L35890 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
L35889 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ Just perfect.
L35888 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Yes sir.
L35887 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
L35886 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
L35885 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ Good.
L35884 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
L35883 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
L35882 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ I can completely understand your distress, sir.
L35881 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
L35880 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Really!
L35879 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ And it is my pleasure to be here.
L35878 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
L36491 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Vengeance.
L36490 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ What the hell is that sound?
L36267 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
L36266 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ What is that?
L36265 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
L36264 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ Can you put men at all four?
L36263 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
L36262 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ In English, Pinkerton.
L36261 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
L36260 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ No.
L36259 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ So he's won.
L36165 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ It's going to be a long spring.
L36164 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ Can't you tell me anything?
L36163 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
L36162 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ I demand action.
L36161 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
L36156 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.
L36155 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ I can't believe this.
L36154 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
L36152 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
L36151 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
L36120 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ It's going to be a long winter.
L36119 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ So you can't tell me anything?
L36118 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
L36117 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
L36116 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
L36100 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Oh, that's the best part.
L36099 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ "The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
L36098 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ It is a nice piece of writing.
L36097 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ "A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
L36096 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
L36095 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ This is no game.
L36094 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
L36093 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ I want them arrested and hanged!
L36092 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
L36091 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ You wouldn't have done that?
L36085 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
L36084 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
L37123 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Nothing.
L37122 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yes?
L37121 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Patrick?
L37118 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yes, Courtney?
L37117 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Isn't that special?  Patrick?
L37116 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
L37115 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
L37114 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ You never noticed.
L37113 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I never knew you smoked.
L37112 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
L37111 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ You and...Luis?
L37110 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ That's nice.
L37109 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
L37108 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ What are you doing tonight?
L37107 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Maybe.
L37106 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
L36778 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Oh God, just get it over with.
L36777 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
L36776 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
L36775 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
L36773 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip ֠ to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
L36772 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Why?
L36771 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Take it off.
L36770 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ It's a plain end, see? So?
L36769 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
L36768 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
L36767 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Turn the light on.
L36766 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ It's a plain end. I think.
L36765 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ What do you want, Courtney?
L36764 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Pull out, goddamnit!
L36763 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I'm ignoring you.
L36762 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Pull out.
L36761 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Is it a what?
L36760 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
L36759 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
L36758 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Luis is a despicable twit.
L36755 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
L36754 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
L36753 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yes, dear.
L36752 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ This is Dorsia?
L36751 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yes.
L36750 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Are we here?
L36749 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
L36748 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ J&B. Straight.
L36747 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children... 
L36746 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
L36745 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
L36744 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Is that Donald Trump's car?
L36743 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
L36739 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
L36738 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Pick me up?
L36737 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Eight?
L36736 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Okay. Yeah. What time?
L36735 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
L36734 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ You like it there, don't you?
L36733 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Nice?
L36732 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Dorsia's nice.
L36731 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I'm thinking Dorsia.
L36730 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ I can't.
L36729 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Courtney? Dinner?
L36728 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
L36727 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
L36726 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ I know. Stop it.
L36725 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
L36724 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Uh huh.
L36723 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
L36722 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Yes?
L36721 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Pumpkin?
L36720 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
L36719 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
L36718 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
L36717 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
L36716 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ On a lot of lithium?
L36715 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Stop it. I'm...
L36714 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
L36713 +++$+++ u331 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ What? Oh, I'm...busy.
L36712 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Listen, what are you doing tonight?
L37301 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ It's not that nice.
L37300 +++$+++ u330 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CHRISTIE +++$+++ This is nicer than your other apartment.
L37291 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
L37290 +++$+++ u330 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CHRISTIE +++$+++ My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
L37289 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Really?
L37288 +++$+++ u330 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CHRISTIE +++$+++ Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
L37287 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ So, you're looking great, how have you been?
L37286 +++$+++ u330 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CHRISTIE +++$+++ Alright.
L37285 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Nothing like last time, promise.
L37283 +++$+++ u330 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CHRISTIE +++$+++ I don't think so.
L37282 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
L37281 +++$+++ u330 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CHRISTIE +++$+++ I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
L37056 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
L37055 +++$+++ u330 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CHRISTIE +++$+++ You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
L37040 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Do you take American Express?
L37039 +++$+++ u330 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CHRISTIE +++$+++ I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
L37038 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
L37036 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Would you like to see my apartment?
L37035 +++$+++ u330 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CHRISTIE +++$+++ You just haven't been looking.
L37034 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I haven't seen you around here.
L37367 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I have to return some videotapes.
L37366 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ But where?
L37365 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I'm just leaving.
L37364 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Where are you going?
L37363 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
L37362 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Oh God, I can't believe this.
L37361 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
L37359 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
L37358 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No, no, no.
L37357 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
L37356 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You're inhuman.
L37355 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ We never really shared one.
L37354 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ But what about the past? Our past?
L37353 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yes, I am.
L37352 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You're really serious, aren't you?
L37351 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
L37350 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
L37349 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
L37348 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
L37347 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
L37346 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
L37345 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ We need to talk.
L37344 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
L37343 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Why? What's wrong?
L37342 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
L37341 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I want a firm commitment.
L36683 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ It's not.
L36682 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Your hairline looks like it's receding.
L36681 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No. I'm not. Why should I ?
L36680 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Are you using minoxidil?
L36678 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Everybody has a great body now.
L36677 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ He has a great body

L36674 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Everybody's rich.
L36673 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ He's rich.
L36672 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
L36671 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Why don t you just go for Price?
L36656 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Hi. Pat Bateman.
L36655 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
L36651 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Because I...want...to...fit...in.
L36650 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
L36649 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it.
L36648 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
L36647 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No-I can't take the time off work.
L36646 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ We should do it.
L36645 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Is your Evian spiked?
L36644 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes, darling?
L36643 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Evelyn?
L36642 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Get married. Have a wedding.
L36641 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Do...what.
L36640 +++$+++ u334 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
L37092 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
L37091 +++$+++ u342 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VAN PATTEN +++$+++ Listen, what about dinner?
L37086 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
L37085 +++$+++ u342 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VAN PATTEN +++$+++ Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
L37084 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
L37078 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
L37077 +++$+++ u342 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VAN PATTEN +++$+++ Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
L37076 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ How did you guess?
L37075 +++$+++ u342 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VAN PATTEN +++$+++ Because he dated her.
L37074 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I know her. I knew her.
L37073 +++$+++ u342 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VAN PATTEN +++$+++ But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
L36809 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Nice.
L36808 +++$+++ u342 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VAN PATTEN +++$+++ Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
L36804 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
L36803 +++$+++ u342 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VAN PATTEN +++$+++ Good coloring.
L36802 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Picked them up from the printers yesterday
L36555 +++$+++ u342 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VAN PATTEN +++$+++ What are the rules for a sweater vest?
L36554 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
L37420 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I won't...don't worry.
L37419 +++$+++ u339 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ MRS. WOLFE +++$+++ Don't come back.
L37418 +++$+++ u339 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ MRS. WOLFE +++$+++ Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
L37417 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ But I think...I want to know what happened here.
L37416 +++$+++ u339 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ MRS. WOLFE +++$+++ I think you should go now.
L37415 +++$+++ u339 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ MRS. WOLFE +++$+++ There was no ad in the Times.
L37414 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
L37413 +++$+++ u339 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ MRS. WOLFE +++$+++ You saw the ad in the Times?
L37412 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Are you sure?
L37411 +++$+++ u339 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ MRS. WOLFE +++$+++ No, he doesn't.
L37410 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Doesn't he live here?
L37409 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
L37408 +++$+++ u339 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ MRS. WOLFE +++$+++ Can I help you?
L37407 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No.
L37406 +++$+++ u339 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ MRS. WOLFE +++$+++ Are you my two o'clock?
L37470 +++$+++ u328 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARNES +++$+++ Now, if you'll excuse me.
L37469 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No, you...didn't?
L37468 +++$+++ u328 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARNES +++$+++ Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
L37467 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Why not, you stupid bastard?
L37466 +++$+++ u328 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARNES +++$+++ It's just not.
L37465 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
L37464 +++$+++ u328 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARNES +++$+++ But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
L37463 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
L37462 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
L37461 +++$+++ u328 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARNES +++$+++ Excuse me. I really must he going.
L37460 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
L37459 +++$+++ u328 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARNES +++$+++ Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
L37458 +++$+++ u328 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARNES +++$+++ Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
L37457 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
L37456 +++$+++ u328 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARNES +++$+++ Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
L37455 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Carnes? Wait.
L37453 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
L37452 +++$+++ u328 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARNES +++$+++ By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
L37451 +++$+++ u328 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARNES +++$+++ The message you left.
L37450 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ What exactly do you mean?
L37449 +++$+++ u328 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARNES +++$+++ It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
L37448 +++$+++ u328 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARNES +++$+++ Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
L37447 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yes, naturally.
L37446 +++$+++ u328 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARNES +++$+++ Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
L37443 +++$+++ u328 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARNES +++$+++ Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
L37442 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
L37105 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
L37104 +++$+++ u329 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARRUTHERS +++$+++ Patrick?
L37103 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
L37102 +++$+++ u329 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARRUTHERS +++$+++ Where are you going?
L37101 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ What...is...it?

L36899 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
L36898 +++$+++ u329 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARRUTHERS +++$+++ Patrick? Is that you?
L36784 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
L36783 +++$+++ u329 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARRUTHERS +++$+++ It looks so soft.
L36782 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Uh huh.
L36781 +++$+++ u329 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ CARRUTHERS +++$+++ That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
L36780 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Lucky, I guess.

L37165 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Don't tell me...merchant banking?
L37164 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
L37163 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
L37162 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.

L37158 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
L37148 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Ask me a question.
L37147 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
L36814 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
L36813 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
L36812 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
L36811 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
L36801 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ New card. What do you think?
L36800 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ What's that, a gram?
L36668 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
L36667 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Like what?
L36666 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
L36597 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ I guess you're right...  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!

L36592 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
L36591 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
L36590 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ What?
L36589 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
L36588 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Maybe it's just the light.
L36587 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
L36585 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
L36584 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
L36583 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
L36567 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
L36566 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ That's Paul Owen.
L36563 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ It looks that way, doesn't it?
L36562 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
L37205 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ See you then.
L37204 +++$+++ u338 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ MAITRE D' +++$+++ There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
L37203 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Two at nine? Perfect.
L37202 +++$+++ u338 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ MAITRE D' +++$+++ I said we are totally booked.

L36742 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
L36741 +++$+++ u338 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ MAITRE D' +++$+++ Dorsia.
L37439 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!

L37434 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
L37433 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
L37432 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ What are I doing?
L37431 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Patrick? I can't hear you.
L37430 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
L37429 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
L37428 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Jean-I'm not-
L37427 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Where are you?
L37426 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Hello? Jean, I need help!
L37425 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Patrick? Is that you?

L37253 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
L37252 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
L37251 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
L37250 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
L37249 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
L37248 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
L37242 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Hmmmm.
L37241 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
L37240 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
L37239 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Jean? What?
L37238 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Sorry. 
L37237 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ What...No! Put it in the carton.
L37236 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
L37235 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
L37234 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ What's that?
L37233 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Forget it.
L37232 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Who's Ted Bundy?
L37231 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
L37230 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Growing. I'm glad you said that.
L37229 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
L37228 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
L37227 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
L37226 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
L37225 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Interesting.
L37224 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ No, not really.
L37223 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Do you have a boyfriend?
L37222 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
L37221 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
L37219 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
L37218 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
L37217 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ You can always he thinner. Look...better.
L37216 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
L37215 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I'm on a diet. But thank you.
L37214 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Want a bite?
L37213 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
L37212 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Jean? Sorbet?
L37208 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ They know me.
L37207 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ You didn't give them a name.
L37206 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yes? You're dressed...okay.
L37197 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Dorsia is...fine.
L37196 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
L37195 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
L37193 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
L37192 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
L37191 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No, come on. Anywhere you want.
L37190 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
L37189 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
L37188 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Anywhere you want?
L37186 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Well, isn't this a coincidence.
L37185 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Oh no. I have no plans.
L37184 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ That is...if you're not doing anything.
L37183 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
L37182 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Yes, Patrick?
L37181 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Jean?
L36968 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
L36967 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Yes, Patrick?
L36935 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Can you bring Mr...
L36934 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Patrick?
L36914 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
L36913 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Tell him I'm at lunch.
L36912 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Detective Donald KIMBALL?
L36911 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Who?
L36910 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
L36909 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Ye-es, Je-an?
L36908 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Patrick?
L36907 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ What is it?
L36636 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Thanks, Patrick.
L36635 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Come on, you're prettier than that.
L36634 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ You don't like this, I take it?
L36633 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
L36632 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
L36631 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
L36630 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Yes?
L36629 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ You look nice today.
L36628 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
L36627 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ I'll do it.
L36626 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
L36625 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Oh, something. . romantic?
L36623 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L36622 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
L36621 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Just say no?
L36620 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Just...say...no.
L36619 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Oh? And what should I say?
L36618 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Negative. Cancel it.
L36617 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ After six.
L36616 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ When?
L36615 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
L36614 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
L36613 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
L36612 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
L36611 +++$+++ u336 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Late?
L37178 +++$+++ u332 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ DAISY +++$+++ That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
L37177 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No. I really don't.
L37176 +++$+++ u332 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ DAISY +++$+++ You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
L37175 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ What?
L37174 +++$+++ u332 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ DAISY +++$+++ You think I'm dumb, don't you?
L37173 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ That's...that's too bad.
L37172 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
L37156 +++$+++ u332 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ DAISY +++$+++ Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
L37155 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Welt...it depends, why?
L37154 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
L37153 +++$+++ u332 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ DAISY +++$+++ Well...
L37152 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No. Flattering, but no.
L37151 +++$+++ u332 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ DAISY +++$+++ A model? An actor?
L37150 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ What do you think I do?
L37149 +++$+++ u332 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ DAISY +++$+++ So, what do you do?
L36711 +++$+++ u343 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Okay. Do.
L36710 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinꥠof Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
L36709 +++$+++ u343 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Yeah.
L36708 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Next Saturday?
L36707 +++$+++ u343 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
L36706 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
L36705 +++$+++ u343 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
L36704 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
L36703 +++$+++ u343 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
L36702 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
L36701 +++$+++ u343 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
L36700 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
L36698 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
L36697 +++$+++ u343 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
L36696 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Well.
L36695 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Hello 
L36694 +++$+++ u343 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
L37337 +++$+++ u333 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
L37336 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
L37335 +++$+++ u333 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
L37334 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
L37333 +++$+++ u333 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
L37332 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
L37330 +++$+++ u333 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Does he do this all the time?
L37329 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
L37328 +++$+++ u333 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
L37327 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
L37326 +++$+++ u333 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Patrick, you re a lunatic.
L37325 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
L37324 +++$+++ u333 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
L37323 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No.
L37322 +++$+++ u333 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
L37321 +++$+++ u333 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
L37320 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Paul Owen.
L37319 +++$+++ u333 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Who?
L37318 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ You're at Paul Owen s.
L37317 +++$+++ u333 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
L37316 +++$+++ u333 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Why would I?
L37315 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Don't tell him you're here.
L37314 +++$+++ u333 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
L37313 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
L37308 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ She's from...France.
L37307 +++$+++ u333 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Uh huh?
L37306 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ She's my...cousin.
L37305 +++$+++ u333 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
L37304 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ What do you mean, she was a hot number.
L37400 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
L37399 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
L37398 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and ֠ - you.
L37397 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ So who was he with?
L37396 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ He wasn't with Paul Owen.
L37395 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Where was Marcus?
L37394 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
L37393 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ I checked it out. It's clean.
L37392 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ He does? You're sure?
L37391 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Yes.
L37390 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
L37389 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Yes.
L37388 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ But Marcus denied it?
L37387 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
L37386 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Marcus?
L37385 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ I've questioned him.
L37384 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ And?
L37383 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
L37382 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
L37381 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
L37380 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
L37379 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
L37378 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Suit yourself, I guess.
L37377 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
L37376 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
L37375 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Not in the mood, I guess.
L37374 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ No hash browns?
L37280 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I'll be there.
L37279 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
L37278 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
L37277 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Not a big music fan, eh?
L37276 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
L37274 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
L37273 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
L37272 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Great, yes, I'd like that.
L37271 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
L37270 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
L37269 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
L37268 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
L37267 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
L37266 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Well, I could he wrong.
L37265 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Let's see...  That you were with-
L37264 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
L37263 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ That's not the information I've received.
L37262 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ What?
L37261 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Wait. That's not what I've got.
L37260 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
L37259 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
L37258 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
L37257 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Not really.
L37256 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
L37255 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
L37135 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
L37134 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ I mean they want to get caught.
L37132 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
L37131 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
L37130 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
L37129 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
L37128 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
L37127 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ So...you hang out here a lot?
L37126 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Don.
L37125 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
L37029 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
L37028 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
L37027 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
L37025 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Oh really? I didn't know that.
L37024 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Uh, no. There's one...down here.
L37023 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
L37022 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
L37021 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Eerie. Really eerie.
L37020 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
L37019 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ People just...disappear.
L37018 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Nothing.
L37017 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
L37016 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ That's so typical, isn't it?
L37015 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
L37014 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
L37013 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
L37012 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Had his apartment been burglarized?
L37011 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ No.
L37010 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Have you consulted a psychic?
L37009 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
L37008 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
L37007 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
L37006 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ What?
L37005 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
L37004 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh.
L37003 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
L37002 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Hmmm.
L37001 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Actually, yes.
L37000 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ But...has anyone seen him in London?
L36999 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ His girlfriend doesn't think so.
L36998 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Well, maybe he did, huh?
L36997 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
L36996 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
L36995 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ So was I.
L36994 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ We were both seven in 1969.
L36993 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
L36991 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
L36990 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Don't you know this?
L36989 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ And where did he go to school?
L36988 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No, he just hung out there.
L36987 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ He had a yacht?
L36986 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
L36985 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Yeah. You know...hang out.
L36984 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Hang...out?
L36983 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Where did Paul hang out?
L36982 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No. Not really.
L36981 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Do you feel that way?
L36980 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
L36979 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
L36978 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
L36977 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
L36975 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ What do you mean...Yale thing?
L36974 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yeah...Yale thing.
L36973 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Yale thing?
L36972 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
L36971 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ How well did you know him?
L36970 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Well...
L36969 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
L36966 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No problem. 
L36965 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ You sure?
L36964 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No, I guess it's okay.
L36963 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Would you rather I not smoke?
L36962 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ I know. I'm sorry.
L36961 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Bad habit.
L36959 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ You seem...nervous.
L36958 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Who do you ask?
L36957 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Pardon me, but are you okay?
L36956 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Thanks.
L36955 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Nice. Very nice.
L36954 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
L36953 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Your address?
L36952 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
L36951 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Where did you go to school?
L36950 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
L36949 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ How old are you?
L36948 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Shoot.
L36947 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
L36946 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ You sure? I can always get you a lime.
L36945 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ No, really. I'm okay.
L36944 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Understandable.  Lime?
L36943 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ I think his family wants this kept quiet.
L36942 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
L36941 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ The disappearance of Paul Owen.
L36940 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Well, what's the topic of discussion?
L36939 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ It's no problem
L36938 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Oh no, I'm okay.
L36937 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
L36936 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ KIMBALL.
L36933 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ No, I'm okay.
L36932 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Perrier? San Pellegrino?
L36931 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ No. I'm okay.
L36930 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Coffee?
L36929 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
L36928 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
L36927 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
L36926 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
L36925 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
L36924 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ So, what's the topic of discussion?
L36923 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
L36922 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
L36921 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
L36920 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
L36919 +++$+++ u337 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ KIMBALL +++$+++ No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
L36918 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
L36845 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
L36844 +++$+++ u335 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ HOMELESS MAN +++$+++ I can't...I can't find a shelter
L36843 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
L36842 +++$+++ u335 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ HOMELESS MAN +++$+++ Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
L36841 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Shhhh...it's okay.
L36840 +++$+++ u335 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ HOMELESS MAN +++$+++ You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
L36839 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
L36838 +++$+++ u335 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ HOMELESS MAN +++$+++ Al.
L36837 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Speak up. Come on.
L36836 +++$+++ u335 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ HOMELESS MAN +++$+++ Al.
L36835 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Listen, what's your name?
L36834 +++$+++ u335 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ HOMELESS MAN +++$+++ What am I gonna do?
L36833 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
L36832 +++$+++ u335 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ HOMELESS MAN +++$+++ I'm hungry.
L36831 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
L36830 +++$+++ u335 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ HOMELESS MAN +++$+++ I'm hungry
L36829 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
L36828 +++$+++ u335 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ HOMELESS MAN +++$+++ I'm not...
L36827 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
L36826 +++$+++ u335 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ HOMELESS MAN +++$+++ I'm so hungry.
L36825 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Gee, uh, that's too bad.
L36824 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
L36823 +++$+++ u335 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ HOMELESS MAN +++$+++ I lost my job...
L36822 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
L36821 +++$+++ u335 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ HOMELESS MAN +++$+++ I'm so hungry.
L36820 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ It's cold out, too, isn't it?
L36819 +++$+++ u335 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ HOMELESS MAN +++$+++ I'm so hungry.
L36893 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yes, it is.
L36892 +++$+++ u340 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ Is that a raincoat?
L36891 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ No, Owen.
L36890 +++$+++ u340 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
L36889 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Yes, Owen?
L36888 +++$+++ u340 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ Hey, Halberstam?
L36885 +++$+++ u340 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
L36884 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ You like Huey Lewis and the News?
L36882 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
L36881 +++$+++ u340 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ No, man. I'm gonna bail.
L36880 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
L36879 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
L36878 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Another Martini, Paul?
L36877 +++$+++ u340 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
L36876 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Cecelia is, well...you know 
L36875 +++$+++ u340 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
L36870 +++$+++ u340 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
L36869 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
L36867 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Nobody goes there anymore.
L36866 +++$+++ u340 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
L36865 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
L36864 +++$+++ u340 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ Yeah, well, you're late.
L36863 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
L36793 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
L36792 +++$+++ u340 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
L36791 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ Oh well, you know.
L36790 +++$+++ u340 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
L36789 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ It's...it's...all right.
L36788 +++$+++ u340 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
L36786 +++$+++ u327 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ BATEMAN +++$+++ I've been great. And you?
L36785 +++$+++ u340 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ OWEN +++$+++ Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
L37475 +++$+++ u342 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VAN PATTEN +++$+++ Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
L37474 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
L37473 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.
L37472 +++$+++ u342 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VAN PATTEN +++$+++ What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
L37471 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
L36561 +++$+++ u342 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VAN PATTEN +++$+++ Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
L36560 +++$+++ u341 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
L36559 +++$+++ u342 +++$+++ m20 +++$+++ VAN PATTEN +++$+++ You think so?
L44800 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
L44799 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
L44794 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I can paint anywhere.
L44793 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You don't wanna move, do you?
L44792 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
L44791 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I'm just screwed.
L44788 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You know what I mean.
L44787 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ "Make" him?
L44786 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
L44785 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ 'Gonna wait outside.
L44784 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You are a fanatic.
L44783 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
L44782 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Is it over?
L45453 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You're just afraid to eat it.
L45452 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Right. Wait. A toast.
L45451 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It's gonna get cold.
L45450 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...wanna savor this.
L45449 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Great.
L45448 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Here we go.
L45446 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Oh, right. Hold on.
L45445 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Don't we have any chopsticks?
L45444 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Milo?
L45441 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
L45440 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...What?
L45439 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
L45438 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You look beautiful.
L45437 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Look at me! I'm gonna change.
L45436 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Great!
L45425 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Just shut up?
L45424 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
L45422 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
L45421 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Are you gonna tell me where you went?
L45350 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Milo, you --
L45349 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
L45348 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Milo --
L45347 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
L45346 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He has thousands of employees, Milo --
L45345 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
L45344 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What?
L45343 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Look at this.
L45336 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
L45335 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
L45235 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...Different?
L45234 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That was -- different.
L45230 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Poor baby. You know that's not true.
L45229 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
L45228 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Guilt?
L45227 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
L45226 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I remember.
L45225 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
L45224 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Remember Lyle Barton?
L45223 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ ...Why?
L45222 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
L45221 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Nothing?
L45220 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Nothing.
L45219 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
L45139 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ So you believe me?
L45138 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ ...Whaddo I do?
L45137 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
L45135 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
L45134 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
L45133 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You can't just walk in, either.
L45132 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I can't just walk away!
L45131 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
L45130 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
L45129 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
L45128 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
L45127 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Milo. Why would he --
L45126 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You think I don't know that?
L45125 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ "Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
L45124 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
L45123 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
L45122 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
L45120 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
L45119 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ They hack into people's programs?
L45118 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
L45117 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
L45116 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
L45115 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
L45076 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It was a hate crime.
L45075 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ What're you -- what?
L45074 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Teddy was killed last night.
L45073 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ What!
L45026 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
L45025 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
L45024 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
L45023 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Isn't that -- extreme?
L45022 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
L45021 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I know, I know.
L45020 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He's your boss. He's not your --
L45017 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
L45016 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
L45015 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
L45014 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
L45013 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
L45012 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
L44952 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Milo! What about --?
L44951 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
L44898 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ We're not gonna let it.
L44897 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ That took some fun out of --
L44879 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
L44878 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ When's Brian coming for the TV?
L44875 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You saved my life in alot of ways.
L44874 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
L44873 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
L44872 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No way. You have this -- destiny.
L44871 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
L44870 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Didn't you visit the campus?
L44869 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...But?
L44868 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I think that's great, Milo. I do.
L44867 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
L44826 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
L44825 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
L44824 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
L44823 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
L44822 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It's important.
L44821 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Then you've gotta ask him about that.
L44820 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
L44819 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
L44818 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
L45267 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don't think he knows how.
L45266 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ He wasn't acting?
L45265 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clich顡bout great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
L45218 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Prick.
L45217 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
L45216 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
L45215 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ That'll be a test, won't it?
L45214 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He'll tell me when he gets home.
L45213 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
L45212 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No.
L45211 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ 'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
L45210 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Yes sir.
L45209 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ And Outpost? You're happy there?
L45208 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ 'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
L45207 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
L45206 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
L45205 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
L45204 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
L45203 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ My goodness.
L45202 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
L45201 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Milo?
L45200 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I am. I am, sir.
L45199 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
L45198 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Have a seat.
L45197 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
L45196 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Milo?
L45194 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
L45193 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
L45192 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
L45191 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
L44895 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Like I said: shot in the dark.
L44894 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
L44893 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
L44892 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Right... What's that mean again?
L44891 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
L45563 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
L45562 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ ...When did you know?
L45551 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
L45550 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What?!
L45525 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Is it your dish?
L45524 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Is it your software?
L45520 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Gimme the coordinates?
L45519 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ You're interfaced with our dish.
L45507 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Wanna be a part of history?
L45506 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What?!
L45505 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
L45504 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Okay.
L45503 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ What'd they ever do for you?
L45502 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What?
L45501 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
L45500 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Will I get to work for Outpost?
L45499 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life.
L45498 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
L45497 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
L45047 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ 'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
L45046 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
L45045 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Sure, I'll see what I can do.
L45044 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ 'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
L45043 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You're living here?
L45609 +++$+++ u347 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ CYBER PUNDIT +++$+++ You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
L45608 +++$+++ u351 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY KING +++$+++ We tried!
L45607 +++$+++ u347 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ CYBER PUNDIT +++$+++ Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
L45606 +++$+++ u351 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY KING +++$+++ And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
L45605 +++$+++ u347 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ CYBER PUNDIT +++$+++ Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
L45604 +++$+++ u351 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY KING +++$+++ Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
L45603 +++$+++ u347 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ CYBER PUNDIT +++$+++ There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
L45602 +++$+++ u351 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY KING +++$+++ That'd change with a criminal indictment.
L45601 +++$+++ u347 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ CYBER PUNDIT +++$+++ Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
L45600 +++$+++ u351 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY KING +++$+++ Outpost doesn't own em.
L45599 +++$+++ u347 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ CYBER PUNDIT +++$+++ Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
L45598 +++$+++ u351 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY KING +++$+++ That's gotta kill him, right?
L44835 +++$+++ u348 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
L44834 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Who's that?
L44830 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
L44829 +++$+++ u348 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ We could move 'em up here.
L44828 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ He's pretty tight with his family.
L44827 +++$+++ u348 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ 'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
L44804 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Oh hi.
L44803 +++$+++ u348 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Milo? I'm Danny.
L45419 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
L45418 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
L45416 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
L45415 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
L45414 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You see what's hanging on the wall?
L45413 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Gary, I --
L45409 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
L45408 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
L45407 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You could've handwritten it.
L45406 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
L45405 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ "Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
L45374 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ 'Sorry about the late notice...
L45373 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ That's great! Thanks.
L45296 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
L45295 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
L45294 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ ...Worse?
L45293 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
L45292 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
L45291 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
L45290 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
L45289 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Sure.
L45288 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ 'Have a look?
L45287 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I'm okay. It's going well!
L45286 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You look a little tired.
L45285 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Gary, hi.
L45111 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
L45110 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ The wrong place?
L45109 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
L45108 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ 34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
L45107 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
L45104 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
L45103 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You've been coming in early.
L45102 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Oh. Yeah.
L45101 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I meant did you find other stuff to --
L45100 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Talk about work? Never!
L45099 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Did you?
L45098 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
L45097 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Had you talked to him much lately?
L45096 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Were the flags for Teddy?
L45095 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I heard what happened.
L45010 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Definitely.
L45009 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ It scales, don't you think?
L45008 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
L45007 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I'm sure.
L45006 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
L45005 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Nothing!
L45004 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ What're you implying.
L45003 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You really wrote this just today?
L45002 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Right... Right.
L45001 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Well -- you sent for me.
L45000 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Milo. What's up?
L44972 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You're making me young again.
L44971 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You did this -- overnight?
L44970 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
L44969 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It's okay. Really.
L44967 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
L44966 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Maybe I'm going too fast.
L44965 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ How's it going?
L44949 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
L44948 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
L44942 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ That's what I told her. My wife.
L44941 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
L44940 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
L44939 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...Do I?
L44938 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ 'Think I should buy some originals?
L44937 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Okay. I'm Gary.
L44936 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
L44866 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
L44865 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I do!
L44864 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
L44860 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?
L44859 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
L44858 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
L44857 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Skywire.
L44856 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
L44855 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Low enough to relay internet traffic.
L44854 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
L44851 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
L44850 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You know a lot about art, I guess.
L44847 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Oh. No thanks.
L44846 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Would you like a Coke or something?
L44845 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Cool!
L44808 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
L44807 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
L44806 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...Hello?
L45546 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Just do it.
L45545 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Gary?
L45544 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ 'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
L45543 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ What?
L45542 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Wait... He knows.
L45541 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Longitude 109 --
L45540 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Let's go.
L45539 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Ready for number three?
L45529 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
L45528 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Okay, #2.
L45518 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Just do what I'm asking!
L45517 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Gary, don't worry, we --
L45516 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
L45071 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
L45070 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Hasn't affected his work, though.
L45069 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
L45068 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ What'd the girl say?
L44964 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Maybe we should all get on it.
L44963 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ 'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
L44962 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ This is good. Who did it?
L45619 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Cool.
L45618 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
L45614 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Got out of my other commitment.
L45613 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ ...You wanna work -- here?
L45612 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ We'll come up with the next big thing.
L45611 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
L45092 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Those really weird, short lines.
L45091 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
L45090 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
L45089 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
L45088 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Just thought his work should go on.
L45087 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
L45086 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
L44817 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I mean, it's your life.
L44816 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You do?
L44815 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I think you should go.
L44811 +++$+++ u350 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
L44810 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
L45567 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
L45566 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
L45462 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ Where we going?
L45461 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Come with me.
L45459 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ I'm calling Gary.
L45458 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ You calling Phil and Randy?
L45427 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
L45426 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
L45360 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Let's get him in here.
L45359 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
L45341 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Any irregularity in the pattern.
L45340 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ What're we looking for?
L45339 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Keep looking.
L45338 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ Every entry was authorized.
L45280 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.  I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  Let's run a printout on card entries.
L45279 +++$+++ u352 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LEN +++$+++ Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
L45278 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
L45549 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Wait a second. He knows I know.
L45548 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Latitude 47 degrees.
L45538 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.
L45537 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What?
L45536 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...He knows.
L45527 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Let's try #2.
L45526 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Maybe it's the satellite.
L45490 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ But you said the other --
L45489 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Bring it to the other location.
L45488 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It's three years old, it --
L45487 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
L45486 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
L45485 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Meet me at the other location.
L45433 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
L45432 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Please don't go.
L45431 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
L45430 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Why?!
L45429 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
L45428 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Does he know you know?
L45384 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You'll come up with something.
L45383 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ That's lame, isn't it?
L45382 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
L45381 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
L45380 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
L45370 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
L45369 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Oh.
L45368 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
L45367 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
L45366 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ He doesn't know about the Day Care.
L45365 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
L45364 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
L45363 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Thank God.
L45362 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ The dishes are juiced up, too.
L45361 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
L45333 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Gary.
L45332 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
L45331 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ "A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
L45330 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What'd he say?
L45329 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I told Teddy about you.
L45328 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ 'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
L45327 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ 'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
L45326 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
L45325 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Why were you snooping in my office?
L45324 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
L45323 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Why were you so careless?
L45321 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
L45320 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I don't know --
L45319 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You mean -- break in?
L45318 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
L45317 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Before they kill somebody else, too.
L45316 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
L45315 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
L45314 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
L45313 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ But they'd still get the idea, right?
L45312 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
L45311 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ A what?
L45310 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
L45309 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
L45308 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ What?
L45307 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ How close are you?
L45303 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
L45302 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Time?
L45301 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?
L45300 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
L45299 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
L45298 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What about "60 Minutes."
L45297 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
L45284 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Certainly not at my happy home.
L45283 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
L45282 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
L45281 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
L45277 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
L45276 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Do we post it on the Net?
L45271 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
L45270 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Who can we trust?
L45269 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
L45268 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What about the FBI?
L45262 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ No, no. Never.
L45261 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
L45260 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Hmm?
L45259 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ ...Milo?
L45256 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
L45255 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ He's out of prison?
L45254 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ They'd frame him.
L45253 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
L45251 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L45250 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
L45246 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
L45245 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ But why would they --?
L45244 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
L45242 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ The Day Care?
L45241 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
L45240 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Why would you do a thing like --
L45239 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I snuck into #21.
L45049 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ She saved my life.
L45048 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ That's great. I -- didn't know.
L45040 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Then and now.  But not right now.
L45039 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
L45038 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Long story. Not that interesting.
L45037 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Why's that?
L45036 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
L45035 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You're compulsive.
L45034 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
L45033 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
L45032 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
L45031 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ "There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
L45030 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
L45029 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ No. Please.
L45028 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Did you wanna be alone?
L44993 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
L44992 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Cool!
L44991 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Show me.
L44990 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
L44989 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ What've you got there?
L44987 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
L44986 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Did I say something?
L44985 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
L44984 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ ...Something like that. Yeah.
L44983 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
L44982 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
L44981 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...Were you?
L44980 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
L44979 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
L44978 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You're famous around here.
L44977 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You know mine.
L44976 +++$+++ u353 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You know my name.
L44975 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Lisa.
L45067 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I didn't plan this.
L45066 +++$+++ u359 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
L45065 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ What does that mean?
L45064 +++$+++ u359 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
L45063 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ What d'you mean?
L45062 +++$+++ u359 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
L45061 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
L45060 +++$+++ u359 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ Did you tell Alice?
L45059 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I don't know.
L45058 +++$+++ u359 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ What? Come on. Is it serious?
L45057 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I met this girl.
L45056 +++$+++ u359 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
L45055 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Jesus, Teddy.
L45054 +++$+++ u359 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
L45053 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ What?!
L45052 +++$+++ u359 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
L44888 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
L44887 +++$+++ u359 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
L44886 +++$+++ u359 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
L44885 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Wanted to say goodbye to him...
L44884 +++$+++ u359 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ Uh. Not exactly.
L44883 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Is that how Larry feels?
L44882 +++$+++ u359 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
L44881 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...You got my E-mail?
L44929 +++$+++ u357 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ REDMOND +++$+++ You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
L44928 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
L44927 +++$+++ u357 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ REDMOND +++$+++ #21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
L44926 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ What're they building?
L44917 +++$+++ u357 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ REDMOND +++$+++ Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost.
L44916 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I've got a girlfriend, remember?
L44915 +++$+++ u357 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ REDMOND +++$+++ Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
L44914 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ She's a programmer?
L44913 +++$+++ u357 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ REDMOND +++$+++ Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
L44905 +++$+++ u357 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ REDMOND +++$+++ Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
L44904 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
L44903 +++$+++ u357 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ REDMOND +++$+++ So how'd you like the house?
L44833 +++$+++ u357 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ REDMOND +++$+++ Oh we're not going to the campus.
L44832 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ So -- how far are we from the campus?
L45171 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ You don't look anything like a three- year-old.
L45170 +++$+++ u356 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
L45169 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
L45167 +++$+++ u356 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.
L45166 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Speaking of which...
L45165 +++$+++ u356 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Maybe he'll get back to work.
L44841 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.
L44840 +++$+++ u356 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
L44839 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
L45484 +++$+++ u356 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
L45483 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
L45482 +++$+++ u356 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
L45475 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ We're too late. Take a look.
L45474 +++$+++ u356 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ Where is he?
L45473 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Who're these guys?
L45157 +++$+++ u356 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ You're not listening.
L45156 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ I could get it out of him.
L45155 +++$+++ u356 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ That kid's the great white hope.
L45153 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
L45152 +++$+++ u356 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
L45151 +++$+++ u358 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ SHROT +++$+++ Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
L45150 +++$+++ u356 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ RANDY +++$+++ What is it?
L56281 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
L56280 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
L56279 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
L56278 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
L56277 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ Yes.
L56276 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Is it about my teeth?
L56275 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
L56274 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ Kiss me.
L56273 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ To my health.
L56272 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
L56271 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ 'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
L56270 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
L56269 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ 'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
L56268 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
L56267 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
L56266 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Sak-i it to me!
L56265 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ Care for some saki?
L56264 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Or sometimes not at all.
L56263 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ In Japan, men come first and women come second.
L56262 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Groovy.
L56261 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ May I wash you?
L56260 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
L56259 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I'd rather talk about Number Two.
L56258 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ Come in.
L56257 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Behave!
L56256 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
L56255 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I didn't, baby, you just told me.
L56254 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
L56253 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
L56252 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ You may.
L56251 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
L56250 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
L56249 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
L56248 +++$+++ u360 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ALOTTA +++$+++ I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
L56247 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ You seem surprised to see me.
L55905 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Smashing!
L55904 +++$+++ u361 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ "Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
L55903 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
L55902 +++$+++ u361 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
L55901 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
L55900 +++$+++ u361 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ Hungry.
L55899 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Hey, how are you?
L55898 +++$+++ u361 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
L56636 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Be careful!
L56635 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Yes Basil?
L56634 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
L56631 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
L56630 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
L56629 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Austin, I have something for you as well.
L56628 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
L56625 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
L56624 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
L56623 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
L56341 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Thanks.
L56340 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Be careful.
L56339 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Yes, Basil?
L56338 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
L56337 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
L56336 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ All right, Austin, I think you should go.
L56333 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
L56332 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
L56331 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
L56325 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ That's not your mother, that's a man!
L56324 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ My God, Austin, what have you done?
L56316 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
L56315 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
L56314 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
L56313 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
L56312 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ What?
L56311 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Carnies.
L56310 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ What's the other thing you're scared of?
L56309 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Excuse me?
L56308 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ What's the other?
L56307 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
L56306 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
L56305 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Hello, Exposition.
L56242 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Thank you.
L56241 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Be careful.
L56240 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Yes?
L56239 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ There's one more thing, Austin.
L56238 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Oh, yes. Thank you.
L56237 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
L56236 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Yes?
L56235 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Oh, and Austin...
L56234 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Thank you, Basil.
L56233 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
L56232 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ She's working on another lead right now.
L56231 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Where is Vanessa, by the way?
L56230 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Right away, Exposition.
L56229 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
L56036 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Be careful.
L56035 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Yes?
L56034 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Oh, and Austin...
L56033 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Thank you, Exposition.
L56032 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
L55984 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Thanks.
L55983 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Be careful.
L55982 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Yes?
L55981 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Oh, and Austin...
L55980 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Thank you, Exposition.
L55979 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
L55973 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
L55972 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Vanessa's one of our top agents.
L55971 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
L55970 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ You mean Mrs. Kensington?
L55969 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
L55968 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ When do I begin?
L55965 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
L55964 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ We won, Austin.
L55963 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
L55962 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
L55961 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
L55960 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
L55959 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
L55958 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
L55957 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
L55956 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
L55955 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Where am I?
L55890 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
L55889 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Be careful.
L55888 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Yes?
L55887 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Oh, and Austin...
L55886 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Thank you.
L55885 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Good luck, Austin.
L55884 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
L55883 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
L55882 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
L55881 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
L55880 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ We know all that, Exposition.
L55879 +++$+++ u363 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ BASIL EXPOSITION +++$+++ Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
L55897 +++$+++ u370 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MICK JAGGER +++$+++ Groovy!
L55896 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Good on ya, man.
L55895 +++$+++ u370 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MICK JAGGER +++$+++ "You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
L55894 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Well, you can't always get what you want.
L55893 +++$+++ u370 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MICK JAGGER +++$+++ Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
L55892 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Hey, Mick!
L55891 +++$+++ u370 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MICK JAGGER +++$+++ Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
L56580 +++$+++ u366 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DESTRUCTACON +++$+++ Love is... love is... love is...
L56579 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Why not? It's a question.
L56578 +++$+++ u366 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DESTRUCTACON +++$+++ That does not compute.
L56577 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
L56576 +++$+++ u366 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DESTRUCTACON +++$+++ Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
L56575 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
L56574 +++$+++ u366 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DESTRUCTACON +++$+++ Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
L56603 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Man, you are one chilly square!
L56602 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
L56601 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
L56597 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
L56596 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
L56595 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
L56594 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
L56593 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
L56592 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I've got you, Dr. Evil!
L56483 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
L56482 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
L56453 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
L56452 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
L56451 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
L56450 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ What's wrong with your hand?
L56621 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Behave!
L56620 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Kiss me.
L56619 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
L56618 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I love you, Austin.
L56617 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Lay it on me.
L56616 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I have something to tell you.
L56572 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'll secure the perimeter.
L56571 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
L56570 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Austin, I'm coming with you.
L56568 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Don't worry!
L56567 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Are you crazy?
L56566 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
L56562 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
L56561 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
L56560 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
L56559 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Likewise.
L56558 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
L56539 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Oh, behave!
L56538 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
L56537 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Austin, what's your point?
L56536 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
L56535 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'll hurry back.
L56534 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
L56533 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
L56532 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
L56531 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ What do we do now?
L56518 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Fair enough.
L56517 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Shut up.
L56516 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
L56515 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Yes.
L56514 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ That's not the way to get ahead in life.
L56513 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Indeed.
L56512 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Not a good time to lose one's head.
L56507 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Smashing idea! Give it to me.
L56506 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
L56505 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
L56504 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
L56503 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
L56456 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Not now, Austin.
L56455 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Does that make you horny?
L56438 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
L56437 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Thank God, Austin, we made it.
L56405 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
L56404 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
L56399 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
L56398 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
L56397 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ You know who.
L56396 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Who?
L56395 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Do you think she's prettier than I?
L56394 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
L56360 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
L56359 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Out and about, doing odds and sods.
L56358 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
L56357 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
L56356 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
L56355 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Hello, luv.
L56354 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
L56353 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
L56352 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
L56351 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
L56350 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Not in the Nineties.
L56349 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Only sailors use condoms, man.
L56348 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ No, did you use a condom?
L56347 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
L56346 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
L56345 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
L56344 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
L56343 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Of course, luv.
L56342 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Austin, may I have a word with you?
L56335 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
L56334 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Really, Austin!
L56228 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
L56227 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
L56226 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I can't. You're drunk.
L56225 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
L56224 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Oh, yes you are.
L56223 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I am not.
L56222 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ You're smashed, Vanessa.
L56220 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ No, this is me in a nutshell.
L56219 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
L56218 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
L56217 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Why?
L56216 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L56215 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I haven't had fun like that since college.
L56210 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Go! Just go!
L56209 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
L56208 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Watch out, you're on my hair!
L56207 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I couldn't have another bite.
L56206 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Fancy a nibble?
L56198 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
L56197 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I hate having my picture taken.
L56195 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
L56194 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
L56193 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
L56192 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I don't get it.
L56191 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
L56190 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ We can't just sit here, Austin.
L56189 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ He's too well-protected right now.
L56188 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Let's go get him!
L56187 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I never forget a pussy... cat.
L56186 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ How do you know?
L56185 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
L56184 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Let me see.
L56183 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ A limousine has just pulled up.
L56182 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
L56181 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Why?
L56180 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
L56176 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Do you want to talk to him?
L56175 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
L56142 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
L56141 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Why did you leave so soon?
L56126 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
L56125 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I can't see a bloody thing.
L56112 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.
L56111 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Here, use mine.
L56110 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
L56107 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
L56106 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'm sure.
L56105 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
L56098 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
L56097 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
L56096 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
L56095 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
L56094 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
L56029 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
L56028 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
L56027 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
L56026 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
L56025 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ What?
L56024 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Do I make you horny?
L56023 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Sure.
L56022 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
L56014 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
L56013 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
L56012 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
L56011 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ A Chigro?
L56010 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
L56009 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
L56008 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ My meat and two veg.
L56007 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'm sorry?
L56006 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ My wedding tackle.
L56005 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Excuse me?
L56004 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
L56003 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L56002 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
L56001 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
L56000 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
L55999 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
L55998 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
L55997 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
L55978 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
L55977 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
L55976 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ My mother's told me all about you.
L55975 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
L55974 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
L55996 +++$+++ u364 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.
L55995 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
L55994 +++$+++ u364 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
L55993 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
L55992 +++$+++ u364 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
L55991 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ That's not mine.
L55990 +++$+++ u364 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
L55989 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Danger's my middle name.
L55988 +++$+++ u364 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ It says here, name Danger Powers.
L55987 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
L55986 +++$+++ u364 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Danger Powers, personal effects.
L56431 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Where did you learn to shoot?
L56430 +++$+++ u369 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Noooooooooooooo!
L56420 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
L56419 +++$+++ u369 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
L56418 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
L56417 +++$+++ u369 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
L56416 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Don't mind if I do.
L56415 +++$+++ u369 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Here, have a piece of gum.
L56414 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Here, have a piece of gum.
L56410 +++$+++ u369 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Hey, wait a minute--
L56409 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Everything seems to be in order.
L56407 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Sure.
L56406 +++$+++ u369 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
L55936 +++$+++ u365 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ COMMANDER GILMOUR +++$+++ That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
L55935 +++$+++ u374 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ RADAR OPERATOR +++$+++ Commander, I have to log it...
L55932 +++$+++ u365 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ COMMANDER GILMOUR +++$+++ What's its current position?
L55931 +++$+++ u374 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ RADAR OPERATOR +++$+++ Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
L55930 +++$+++ u365 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ COMMANDER GILMOUR +++$+++ Shut up.
L55929 +++$+++ u374 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ RADAR OPERATOR +++$+++ In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
L55928 +++$+++ u365 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ COMMANDER GILMOUR +++$+++ Oh my God, he's back.
L55927 +++$+++ u374 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ RADAR OPERATOR +++$+++ It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
L55926 +++$+++ u365 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ COMMANDER GILMOUR +++$+++ What are you saying, son?
L55925 +++$+++ u374 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ RADAR OPERATOR +++$+++ No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
L55924 +++$+++ u365 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ COMMANDER GILMOUR +++$+++ Is it one of ours?
L55923 +++$+++ u374 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ RADAR OPERATOR +++$+++ Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
L56058 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
L56057 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Right. Okay. Moving on.
L56056 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ Ow! You shot me!
L56054 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
L56053 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
L56052 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
L56051 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
L56050 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ We've got a lot of work to do.
L56047 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
L56046 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ Ahhhhhhhhh!
L56045 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Silence!
L56044 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
L56043 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
L56042 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
L56041 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
L56040 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
L56496 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Please allow me to demonstrate.
L56495 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Really? Are they ill-tempered?
L56494 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ They're mutated sea bass.
L56493 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Right.
L56492 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Sea bass.
L56491 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
L56490 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
L56489 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ What is it now?
L56488 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
L56487 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
L56486 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
L56485 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Dr. Evil?
L56484 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
L56288 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
L56287 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Thank you, Herr Doctor.
L56286 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Quite impressive.
L56285 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
L56284 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
L56283 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
L56282 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
L56090 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Yes.  Scott!
L56089 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ My son?
L56088 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
L56087 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Yes.
L56086 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
L56391 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
L56390 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
L56389 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
L56388 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
L56385 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
L56384 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
L56364 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
L56363 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
L56607 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Scott, don't say that...
L56606 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
L56605 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
L56604 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
L56545 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Show me.
L56544 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ What did you say?
L56543 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Blow me.
L56542 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
L56541 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ I don't want to.
L56540 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
L56501 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
L56500 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
L56499 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
L56498 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
L56497 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
L56480 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
L56479 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
L56478 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
L56477 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
L56476 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ In due time.
L56475 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
L56474 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
L56473 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Yeah. What?
L56472 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
L56471 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
L56470 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
L56469 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
L56468 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
L56380 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
L56379 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ An evil petting zoo?
L56378 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
L56377 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ An evil vet?
L56374 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Not me.
L56373 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
L56093 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
L56092 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
L56091 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Hi.
L56085 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
L56084 +++$+++ u373 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ NUMBER TWO +++$+++ Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
L56083 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
L56082 +++$+++ u373 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ NUMBER TWO +++$+++ Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
L56081 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
L56080 +++$+++ u373 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ NUMBER TWO +++$+++ Umm, that also has already happened.
L56079 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
L56078 +++$+++ u373 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ NUMBER TWO +++$+++ Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
L56077 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
L56076 +++$+++ u373 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ NUMBER TWO +++$+++ We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
L56179 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ I love you, Vanessa.
L56178 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
L56177 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
L56174 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
L56173 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ You didn't answer my question, Mum.
L56172 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
L56171 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Did you ever want to?
L56170 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ Of course not. I was married to your father.
L56169 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Did you ever...
L56168 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
L56167 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I just don't see it.
L56166 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
L56165 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ What about his teeth?
L56164 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
L56163 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
L56162 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
L56161 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Why?
L56160 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ I'm proud of you.
L56159 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
L56158 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ You didn't...
L56157 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ He's asleep.
L56156 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ How's Austin?
L56155 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Great.
L56154 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
L56387 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
L56386 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
L56383 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ Scott.
L56382 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ No, he's really evil.
L56381 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ We don't label people here, Scott.
L56376 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
L56375 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ What do you want to do, Scott?
L56372 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ I don't wanna take over the family business.
L56371 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ And how do you feel about that?
L56370 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
L56369 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ We don't judge here.
L56368 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Well, it's kind of weird.
L56367 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
L57766 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ No need. I'll call again.
L57765 +++$+++ u378 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
L57764 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ There are limits?
L57763 +++$+++ u378 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
L57762 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ You don't say. How real does it feel?
L57761 +++$+++ u378 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
L57760 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Seriously?
L57759 +++$+++ u378 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
L57758 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
L57757 +++$+++ u378 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ Really?
L57756 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
L57755 +++$+++ u378 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
L58080 +++$+++ u379 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ DR. DARLING +++$+++ Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
L58079 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Would that I could say the Same.
L57889 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ So I'm still ...
L57888 +++$+++ u379 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ DR. DARLING +++$+++ He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
L57862 +++$+++ u379 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ DR. DARLING +++$+++ Three days.
L57861 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ How long have I been here?

L57714 +++$+++ u386 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ SIR AUGUST +++$+++ Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
L57650 +++$+++ u386 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ SIR AUGUST +++$+++ There, look!
L57649 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Promised? Who promised?
L57648 +++$+++ u386 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ SIR AUGUST +++$+++ Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
L57644 +++$+++ u386 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ SIR AUGUST +++$+++ You mean you don't recall??
L57643 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Have we met?
L57642 +++$+++ u386 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ SIR AUGUST +++$+++ You
L57641 +++$+++ u386 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ SIR AUGUST +++$+++ Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
L57640 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
L57639 +++$+++ u386 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ SIR AUGUST +++$+++ You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
L57638 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
L57504 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Really -- what happened in 1922?
L57503 +++$+++ u385 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
L57502 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I have an appointment.
L57501 +++$+++ u385 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Then you can't come in.
L57500 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ As you see.
L57499 +++$+++ u385 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ You are female?
L57498 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Impossible?
L57497 +++$+++ u385 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ I'm afraid that's impossible.
L57496 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Mr. John Steed, please.
L57495 +++$+++ u385 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ May I help you, madam ...
L58072 +++$+++ u389 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
L58071 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Then who wins?
L58070 +++$+++ u389 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ People, too.
L58069 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Rules are made to be broken.
L58068 +++$+++ u389 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Quite right, but we still make the rules.
L58067 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ This isn't a game.
L58066 +++$+++ u389 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
L57818 +++$+++ u389 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ We have met ...
L57817 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
L57816 +++$+++ u389 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
L57815 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Quite a collection.
L57637 +++$+++ u389 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Eh? In here!
L57636 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
L58221 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Thank you, Steed.
L58220 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
L58217 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Next assignment?
L58216 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
L57894 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ So am I.
L57893 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
L57892 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ To find out who killed my husband.
L57891 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
L57883 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
L57882 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Who?
L57877 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
L57876 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ The Institute ... the funding ...
L57875 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
L57873 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ To you ... ?
L57872 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
L57871 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
L57870 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ We want to help...!
L57869 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ What are you trying to do to me?
L57867 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Watch me.
L57866 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
L57865 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I resign.
L57752 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ After the cold war ...
L57751 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
L57749 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
L57748 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
L57736 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ He tried to warn us ...
L57735 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
L57565 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Ropes?
L57564 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
L57553 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
L57552 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ How curious ...
L57542 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Let me guess -- 'Father'?
L57541 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ My number two. Special assignments. She's --
L57535 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Looks like rain, Steed...
L57534 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Hmmm ...
L57533 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
L58142 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I'll never marry you.
L58141 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Choices?
L58140 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ What are my choices?
L58139 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
L58138 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
L58137 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
L58136 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
L58135 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Then what's stopping you?
L58134 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
L58133 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ The result would be ...
L58132 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
L58131 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Such as?
L58123 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --
L58122 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You're mad.
L58121 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
L58118 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Ring?
L58117 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
L58116 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Valentine, listen to me ...
L58115 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
L58113 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
L58112 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I'm already married ...
L58111 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
L58108 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
L58107 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ 'Our revels now are ended.'
L58106 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
L58105 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ But -- why?
L58104 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Of course. I planned that, too.
L58103 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
L58102 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
L58101 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Too many cooks --
L58100 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
L58099 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You killed my husband.
L58098 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ An unholy trinity ...
L58097 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
L58096 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
L58093 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
L58092 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You.
L57465 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Thanks, Valentine ...
L57464 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
L58219 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
L58218 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
L58214 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Pity your mother came, too ...
L58213 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Our chaperon.
L58212 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Not quite.
L58211 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Our little paradise -- just made for two?
L58210 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
L58209 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
L58208 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ As a matter of fact I have ...
L58207 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Have you any place in mind?
L58206 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
L58205 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Still a bit chilly ...
L58204 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
L58203 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ '... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
L58202 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ 'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
L58200 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
L58199 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ What kept you?
L58198 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Mrs. Peel?
L58038 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
L58037 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
L58036 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ But --
L58035 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
L58034 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
L58033 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
L58032 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Where are you going?
L58031 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I'll be back ...
L58016 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Have a look at this.
L58015 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
L58008 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ 'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
L58007 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
L58006 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
L58005 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Trubshaw again? What now?
L58002 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Shall we?
L58001 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ You first.
L58000 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
L57999 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
L57998 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ What is it?
L57997 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
L57996 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ It's called Black Leather.
L57995 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ What's that you're wearing?
L57987 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Have we been invited?
L57986 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
L57981 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ You didn't tell her?
L57980 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
L57979 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
L57962 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
L57961 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Aren't you coming?
L57960 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ You'll find out.
L57959 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Why's he called 'Invisible'?
L57958 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
L57957 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
L57956 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
L57955 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
L57954 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
L57953 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ ... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
L57952 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
L57951 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ No idea who. No idea why ...
L57950 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
L57948 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
L57947 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You lied.
L57946 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I told Mother I took care of you.
L57937 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ As far as you trust me.
L57936 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ You don't trust me?
L57935 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ No, after you.
L57934 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
L57933 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
L57932 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Winning isn't everything.
L57931 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I'm playing to win.
L57930 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I thought you didn't.
L57929 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I thought you played by the rules.
L57928 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
L57927 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You're playing games.
L57926 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Not for a moment.
L57925 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ But you did suspect me.
L57923 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Is that all?
L57922 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Keeping a stiff upper lip?
L57921 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Mmm ... what are you doing?
L57915 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ It wasn't me; you have my word.
L57914 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
L57913 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ And do you trust me?
L57912 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ ... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
L57911 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Yes ... ?
L57910 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Always.  Except ...
L57909 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Because you always obey orders ...
L57908 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ No trouble.
L57907 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I could save you the trouble.
L57904 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Nothing personal.
L57903 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ To kill me?
L57902 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Orders.
L57901 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You followed me.
L57836 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ It was Peter -- I saw him ...
L57835 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
L57834 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Was I?
L57833 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
L57832 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Where am I?
L57808 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Mrs. Peel ... ?
L57807 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Steed ... !
L57799 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
L57798 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
L57797 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
L57796 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ This must be the last straw.
L57795 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
L57794 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Barely.
L57793 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
L57778 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
L57777 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Do you always drive this fast?
L57776 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
L57775 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Is that what you think?
L57774 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
L57773 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Not that I know of.  Explanation?
L57772 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ ... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
L57771 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
L57770 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ ... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
L57769 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Three agents killed by bad weather...
L57747 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
L57746 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ That's what we were working on.
L57745 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ But if someone miniaturized the process...
L57744 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
L57743 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
L57742 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
L57741 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Is there anything that isn't?
L57740 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Not quite. This is my field.
L57733 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
L57732 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ But
L57713 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
L57712 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ For you, Mrs. Peel.
L57701 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ She had this in her mouth. There, there...
L57700 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
L57699 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Is that written in his shoe?
L57698 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
L57697 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Any ideas?
L57696 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ What on earth?
L57694 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Very good, Steed ...
L57693 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
L57692 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ How on earth can you tell?
L57691 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
L57678 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
L57677 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
L57676 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You mean my other self ...
L57675 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I must say, you look more your old self --
L57674 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Did you say formal? I must dress.
L57673 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
L57672 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
L57671 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Did he say who?
L57670 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
L57669 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
L57668 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
L57667 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Frankly that's how I remember it.
L57666 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
L57665 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Why should they think that?
L57664 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
L57663 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I might say the same.
L57662 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
L57661 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I wasn't about to.
L57660 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
L57659 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Strange.
L57658 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You should be dead.  How do you feel?
L57657 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
L57632 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Small talk.  Try the weather.
L57631 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
L57630 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
L57629 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Any other vices?
L57628 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
L57627 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ June, July ... August?
L57626 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
L57625 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ An eccentric recluse?
L57624 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
L57623 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I meant me.
L57622 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ No thanks.
L57621 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
L57620 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
L57619 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
L57618 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
L57617 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ For a man in my position --
L57616 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
L57615 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ As per mother's instructions.
L57614 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
L57612 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
L57611 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
L57610 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ And I suppose you're the knight.
L57609 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
L57608 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ But why? What's the point?
L57607 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
L57606 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
L57603 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Do you really think so?
L57602 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
L57601 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Thank you, Trubshaw ...
L57600 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
L57599 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
L57598 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Steed, we really must be --
L57595 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Or half cocked.
L57594 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
L57593 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I thought we were on our way.
L57592 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Yes indeed. I need protection.
L57591 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Do you?
L57589 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I had a feeling you would. Touche!
L57588 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Really?  I fail to see the connection.
L57587 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ My father always wanted a boy.
L57548 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
L57547 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
L57537 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
L57536 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ ... Showers followed by sunny periods.
L57525 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Mother?
L57524 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I didn't. Mother did.
L57523 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
L57522 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Much better.
L57521 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
L57520 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
L57519 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ And just what is the game?
L57518 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
L57517 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Rules are made to be broken.
L57516 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
L57515 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Whereas you are.
L57514 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
L57513 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ So what was all this -- some sort of test?
L57512 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
L57511 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ 1922. Why the kippers?
L57510 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
L57509 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I had a spot of bother at the door.
L57508 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I was about to throw in the towel.
L57507 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
L57506 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Doctor Peel, I presume?
L58076 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
L58075 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Decontamination -- ?
L58074 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
L57731 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
L57730 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You don't believe him?
L57726 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
L57725 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Where's Mother?
L57563 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You're saying I have no choice.
L57562 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
L57555 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
L57554 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
L58054 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
L58053 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ You're not venturing alone, surely.
L58052 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I shall need a small plane.
L58051 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
L58050 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
L58049 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Privately owned by ...
L58048 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ ... and now?
L58047 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ 'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
L57989 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Well, I can't possibly go like this.
L57988 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
L57985 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I fail to see --
L57984 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
L57983 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Getting to what?
L57982 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ I was getting to it.
L57978 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
L57977 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Makes two of us.
L57976 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Who's now vanished.
L57975 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
L57974 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Surveillance? By whom?
L57973 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
L57972 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I know all this.
L57971 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
L57970 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Half-brother to be precise.
L57969 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Peter's brother?  But --
L57968 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
L57966 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
L57965 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I see.
L57964 +++$+++ u382 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ INVISIBLE JONES +++$+++ Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
L58129 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
L58128 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
L58127 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
L58126 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
L58125 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ How did you guess?
L58124 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Steed
L58011 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Dead, I'm afraid.
L58010 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ We want Mrs. Peel.
L58009 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Oh, hello ...
L57729 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ So you say ...
L57728 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
L57551 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
L57550 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Global warming?
L57549 +++$+++ u381 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
L58064 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
L58063 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ In your operation.
L58062 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Where?
L58061 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
L58060 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
L58059 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I was hoping you could tell me.
L57898 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Mother and Father know best.
L57897 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Guilty until proven innocent?
L57896 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
L57885 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
L57884 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
L57838 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
L57837 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ This man -- did you see him?
L57739 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Impossible.
L57738 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
L57737 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
L57583 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You.
L57582 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Anyone particular in mind?
L57581 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
L57578 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
L57577 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
L57573 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She may try to kill you.
L57572 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Why?
L57571 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
L57570 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Insane ... ?
L57569 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Possibly. Split personality ...
L57568 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Amnesia?
L57567 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
L57566 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Think she really killed those agents?
L57557 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
L57556 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
L57488 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.

L57486 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Weather's turning nasty.
L57483 +++$+++ u383 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
L57482 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Mother. I thought you were burglars.

L57792 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
L57791 +++$+++ u384 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ OLD LADY +++$+++ Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
L57790 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Both, actually.
L57789 +++$+++ u384 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ OLD LADY +++$+++ You with Mother or Father?
L57788 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ She was ...

L57785 +++$+++ u384 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ OLD LADY +++$+++ Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
L57782 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I think so, thank you so much ...

L58181 +++$+++ u388 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ You said ... one shot.
L58180 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ I do.

L58166 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.

L59527 +++$+++ u390 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ Check out the other guy's buns.
L59526 +++$+++ u404 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ PHOEBE +++$+++ Look at that guy. What a hunk.
L59172 +++$+++ u390 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
L59171 +++$+++ u404 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ PHOEBE +++$+++ I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
L59167 +++$+++ u404 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ PHOEBE +++$+++ Really -- you went with him for two years.
L59166 +++$+++ u390 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ Does Cole know about this?
L59162 +++$+++ u404 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ PHOEBE +++$+++ ...Really?
L59161 +++$+++ u390 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ Debbie's marrying Rick.
L59160 +++$+++ u404 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ PHOEBE +++$+++ What's happening?
L59865 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
L59864 +++$+++ u390 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
L59681 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
L59680 +++$+++ u390 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ That's what we're going to find out...
L59415 +++$+++ u390 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
L59414 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ You're kidding.
L59413 +++$+++ u390 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
L59412 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L59411 +++$+++ u390 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
L59410 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
L59170 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
L59169 +++$+++ u390 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
L59168 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
L59159 +++$+++ u390 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
L59158 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Bobbie, what are you talking about?
L59157 +++$+++ u390 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
L59444 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ Women!
L59443 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
L59423 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
L59422 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Chulo, one thing at a time.
L59421 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
L59146 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
L59145 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
L59134 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ You're kidding.
L59133 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ What?
L59097 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ Yeah. What is it?
L59096 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Rick's got an important announcement to make.
L59095 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
L59138 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ Hey, man, congratulations!
L59137 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
L59132 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
L59131 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ Man, you're losing your audience.
L59099 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
L59098 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I've decided not to run for President.
L59093 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
L59092 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
L59091 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ Hey, you guys, what's going on?
L59432 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
L59431 +++$+++ u407 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RYKO +++$+++ Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
L59377 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ When do the girls get to the party?
L59376 +++$+++ u407 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RYKO +++$+++ All right!
L59325 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
L59324 +++$+++ u407 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RYKO +++$+++ I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
L59323 +++$+++ u391 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ CHULO +++$+++ Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
L59322 +++$+++ u407 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RYKO +++$+++ You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
L59927 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Fan out and look for them.
L59926 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
L59923 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ She's mine!
L59922 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Cole, what the hell are you doing?
L59628 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
L59627 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
L59626 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
L59503 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Shit!
L59502 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Maybe it had something to do.
L59501 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
L59499 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ So does Debbie.
L59498 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
L59496 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
L59495 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
L59494 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ The car for Debbie?
L59493 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
L59492 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'm very happy for you two.
L59491 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I love that car.
L59490 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ The best.
L59489 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Great car.
L59485 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
L59484 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Ooh, be still, my heart.
L59483 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I'm ready to make you another deal.
L59482 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oh, come on, just a little.
L59481 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I don't want any trouble.
L59480 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
L59479 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Rick, I want to talk to you.
L59302 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
L59301 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
L59300 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
L59296 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What is this person's story here?
L59295 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
L59294 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'm marrying Debbie.
L59293 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
L59292 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Not interested.
L59291 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Seventy-five hundred.
L59290 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ No.
L59289 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Five thousand dollars.
L59288 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
L59287 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You dump her and I'll give you cash.
L59286 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Cole...
L59285 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I want Debbie.
L59284 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
L59260 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Bond... James Bond.
L59259 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ And...
L59613 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
L59612 +++$+++ u400 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. T +++$+++ Fine. How's everything going?
L59611 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Yes I did.
L59610 +++$+++ u400 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. T +++$+++ Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
L59609 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Mr. Thomerson.
L59608 +++$+++ u400 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. T +++$+++ Hello?
L59821 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L59820 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
L59819 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ 1002.
L59818 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
L59817 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
L59816 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
L59619 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
L59618 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
L59617 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
L59616 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
L59615 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
L59614 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
L59276 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Keep me informed.
L59275 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Thanks for the advise, sir.
L59274 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
L59273 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ But how can I do that?
L59272 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
L59271 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I've tried to change her mind.
L59270 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
L59269 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Yes, sir, I am.
L59268 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
L59267 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L59266 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Nice shot.
L59262 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Sure have...
L59261 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
L59257 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
L59256 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Hi, everybody. Am I late?
L59213 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
L59212 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I'm going now, Cole.
L59211 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
L59210 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Cole, I'm sorry, I...
L59209 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
L59208 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
L59207 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
L59206 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
L59205 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
L59204 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
L59203 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
L59202 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ No, Cole, I...
L59201 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
L59200 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Cole, we've got to talk.
L59198 +++$+++ u392 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
L59197 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Cole?
L59935 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ You're so romantic...
L59934 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
L59933 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L59932 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Are you okay?
L59907 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You're on.
L59906 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Let's get naked.
L59905 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
L59904 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Yes...
L59903 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
L59898 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
L59897 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L59896 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I am committed. I love you.
L59895 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
L59894 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I don't want that. I want to be with you.
L59893 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
L59892 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
L59891 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Let go of me!
L59890 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Rick, you're lying!
L59889 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ C'mon, I knew it was you.
L59888 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I can't trust you!
L59885 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Why don't you get undressed.
L59884 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
L59883 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
L59373 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I love you.
L59372 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
L59371 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
L59370 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
L59369 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Your mother's not dead.
L59368 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
L59367 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ You're really pissing me off.
L59366 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
L59365 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
L59364 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
L59363 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Can't I just go with you guys?
L59362 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ This is it, lady. Last stop.
L59355 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Gonna get married...
L59354 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
L59353 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ You better not have too much joy.
L59352 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
L59320 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
L59319 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Um... that's very relaxing.
L59318 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Good...
L59317 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ That feels so great.
L59316 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ C'mere.
L59315 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
L59314 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
L59313 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
L59312 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ About what?
L59311 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I don't know... I just feel scared.
L59310 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What's the matter?
L59309 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
L59308 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oh... I got something for that.
L59307 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I can't sleep.
L59306 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Huh? Wha...
L59192 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
L59191 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oh, those. Why do you ask?
L59190 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
L59189 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
L59188 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Are you going to have women at your party?
L59187 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
L59186 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ It looks awful.
L59185 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
L59184 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ You're going to have a bachelor party?
L59183 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
L59182 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
L59181 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
L59180 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I think your dinner's burning.
L59179 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
L59178 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ What are we having?
L59177 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ But a fabulous cook.
L59176 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ God, you're a slob.
L59869 +++$+++ u396 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ ILENE +++$+++ I know what I'm doing... Go!
L59868 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Ilene, are you crazy?
L59867 +++$+++ u396 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ ILENE +++$+++ Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
L59866 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Let's go.
L59522 +++$+++ u396 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ ILENE +++$+++ Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
L59521 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
L59520 +++$+++ u396 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ ILENE +++$+++ Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
L59519 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Are you sure this is a good idea?
L59251 +++$+++ u396 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ ILENE +++$+++ Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
L59250 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Ilene, Rick promised...
L59249 +++$+++ u396 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ ILENE +++$+++ Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
L59248 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
L59247 +++$+++ u396 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ ILENE +++$+++ If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
L59872 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ I hope those guys are all right.
L59871 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ I hope Ilene's all right.
L59767 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Quiet, Mother.
L59766 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
L59679 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Ilene, we don't really know that.
L59678 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ A strange wang right in my palm.
L59264 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ You know your father enjoys his company.
L59263 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Why is Cole here?
L59246 +++$+++ u393 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Great, Mom.
L59245 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
L59815 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Any time, Al.
L59814 +++$+++ u394 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
L59673 +++$+++ u394 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ I think I screwed that one once.
L59672 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Great bathing suit.
L59558 +++$+++ u394 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ Well... hope she'll be very happy.
L59557 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ A real turd.
L59556 +++$+++ u394 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
L59554 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
L59553 +++$+++ u394 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ EXECUTIVE +++$+++ Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
L59518 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ That's more like it.
L59517 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ Give him the works.
L59516 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
L59515 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
L59514 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
L59513 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Why?
L59512 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
L59511 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ What are you...
L59510 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ That's it, prick lips.
L59509 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Screw you!
L59508 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
L59507 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Your whores never showed up.
L59506 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ What are you talking about, asshole?
L59505 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
L59386 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Okay. Nice to meet you both.
L59385 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ They'll be up there in a half hour.
L59384 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
L59380 +++$+++ u397 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ JUMBO +++$+++ Let's see your bread.
L59379 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
L59707 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
L59706 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Rick, I really think I'm in love.
L59705 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
L59533 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I didn't know you were into that.
L59532 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Yes.
L59531 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Hookers beat you up?
L59476 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Screw that.
L59475 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
L59474 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I'm going to see what the hell happened.
L59473 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Guy paints a beautiful picture.
L59472 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
L59471 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ It's true.
L59468 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ What's going on?
L59467 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
L59148 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Let's have a toast.
L59147 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
L59140 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Because I love her. What can I tell you?
L59139 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
L59130 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
L59129 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
L59107 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
L59106 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Let's go.
L59103 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Screw you...
L59102 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Gary, you're quite an animal.
L59101 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
L59593 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Milt?
L59592 +++$+++ u405 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RAJAH +++$+++ Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
L59591 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
L59590 +++$+++ u405 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RAJAH +++$+++ You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
L59589 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
L59588 +++$+++ u405 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RAJAH +++$+++ Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
L59587 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I'll take some.
L59586 +++$+++ u405 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RAJAH +++$+++ That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
L59585 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I want women.
L59584 +++$+++ u405 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RAJAH +++$+++ I'm telling you I am, Joe.
L59583 +++$+++ u395 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You're a pimp?
L59582 +++$+++ u405 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RAJAH +++$+++ What can I be doing for you?
L59853 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Good.
L59852 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ That's it.
L59851 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Is that all the coke in the place?
L59341 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
L59340 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Larry, you and your wife got problems?
L59339 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
L59337 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
L59336 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ So, Larry, how have you been?
L59835 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
L59834 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
L59823 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ It's Bullwinkle.
L59822 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
L59704 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
L59703 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Ha, ha, ha.
L59702 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
L59701 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I couldn't find any razor blades.
L59700 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
L59699 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I'm trying to slash my wrists.
L59698 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What the hell are you doing?
L59606 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
L59605 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Really?
L59604 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Yeah, I guess so.
L59603 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You okay?
L59602 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
L59601 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
L59552 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
L59551 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I just want to be alone.
L59550 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
L59549 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
L59348 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What do you mean, it changes?
L59347 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
L59346 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
L59345 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
L59344 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Right.
L59343 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
L59342 +++$+++ u398 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You want to share it?
L59912 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
L59911 +++$+++ u399 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ You're all under arrest. Open up!
L59406 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
L59405 +++$+++ u399 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
L59404 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
L59403 +++$+++ u399 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ It's on the tenth floor.
L59402 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
L59401 +++$+++ u399 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
L59400 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Are any of those right?
L59910 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
L59909 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
L59856 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ No sob story is going to change my mind.
L59855 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ The end.
L59842 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oh, no!
L59841 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Rick!
L59840 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Welcome, welcome, one and all.
L59244 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
L59243 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Feel free.
L59242 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
L59241 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Mr. Thomerson, I...
L59240 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
L59239 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'd love that.
L59238 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
L59237 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
L59233 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Can't I just maim it a little?
L59232 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
L59230 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ All right, who serves?
L59229 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oops!
L59920 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ It's all right...  So have I.
L59919 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ No, Brett, I...
L59918 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ You've been having strange sex...!
L59917 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ The phone made me do it!
L59916 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ Ed... you're kinky!
L59278 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ You can tell a man by his friends.
L59277 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
L59253 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
L59252 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
L59235 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ No. Let's at least finish the set.
L59234 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
L59083 +++$+++ u410 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Of course.
L59082 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
L59078 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
L59077 +++$+++ u410 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I'm separated.
L59076 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Mrs.?
L59075 +++$+++ u410 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
L59074 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
L59879 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ You got it.
L59878 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
L59877 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ What's with her costume?
L59876 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ My Debbie?
L59875 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Debbie.
L59874 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Who?
L59873 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
L59860 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'm saved. Let's party!
L59859 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Reach out and snort someone.
L59847 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ I'll stop him... You stall him.
L59846 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
L59845 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ What are you going to do about it?
L59826 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
L59825 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ How about this, a Trojan donkey.
L59806 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Who's your friend?
L59805 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Hey, you guys...
L59784 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Take care.
L59783 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Now, don't get into any trouble.
L59744 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
L59743 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Very.
L59742 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ He look familiar?
L59741 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Still drawing a blank.
L59740 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ How 'bout this?
L59739 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Got me.
L59738 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What's this?
L59737 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ I don't know.
L59736 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Who was that?
L59733 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ I'm proud of you, lad.
L59732 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
L59731 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ How'd it go?
L59720 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ That's the old Rick!
L59719 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
L59718 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Right in there, pal.
L59717 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oooooo.
L59716 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
L59715 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
L59714 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
L59713 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ About what?
L59712 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Rick, I'm concerned.
L59656 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
L59655 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
L59654 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ So long, Father.
L59653 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I think you'll enjoy this table.
L59638 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ The best table in the house.
L59637 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Under the table!
L59636 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ My gift to you.
L59635 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What the hell is that?
L59632 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ C'mon. I insist.
L59631 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'm not really hungry.
L59630 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
L59629 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
L59439 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ This isn't right.
L59438 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
L59428 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Then it's on to the real thing.
L59427 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Olivier's in that, right?
L59426 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
L59375 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Nothing... Let's get crazy!
L59374 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ What's the matter?
L59330 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
L59329 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Where the hell is he?
L59087 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
L59086 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Where'd she go?
L59808 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
L59807 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
L59690 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
L59689 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
L59688 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
L59687 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
L59665 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
L59664 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
L59222 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
L59221 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
L59220 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
L59219 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
L59218 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
L59217 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
L59216 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
L59066 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Right... Think it over.
L59065 +++$+++ u408 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ SISTER MARY FRANCIS +++$+++ Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
L59064 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
L59062 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
L59061 +++$+++ u408 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ SISTER MARY FRANCIS +++$+++ There can be no excuse for tardiness.
L59060 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
L59059 +++$+++ u408 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ SISTER MARY FRANCIS +++$+++ You're late again, Rick.
L59804 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
L59803 +++$+++ u407 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RYKO +++$+++ Can you believe how perfect it fits?
L59802 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
L59801 +++$+++ u407 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RYKO +++$+++ Maybe I did... I don't remember.
L59800 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
L59799 +++$+++ u407 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RYKO +++$+++ I don't know.
L59798 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
L60866 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Stevie... I...
L60865 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
L60859 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
L60858 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ ...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
L60851 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ -- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
L60850 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- Knock it off!
L60844 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
L60843 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
L60842 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
L60609 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
L60608 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Let me take the lead, Stephen...
L60607 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
L60606 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
L60605 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
L60336 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ We're gonna be okay, man...
L60335 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Biggest in two battalions.
L60334 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
L60333 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Yeah...
L60332 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You know Knowlton pretty well?
L60303 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ No.  I need a drink.
L60302 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
L60209 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
L60208 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ That's Franny. She likes firemen.
L60134 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
L60133 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
L60132 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
L60131 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Wash it to the windows?
L60126 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Be gentle.
L60125 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Oh these moments do try me...
L60855 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ -- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
L60854 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- Stephen, this is bullshit --
L60853 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ -- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
L60852 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- He killed people --
L60849 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ -- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
L60848 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Just come down, John. Just --
L60847 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ You gotta let me finish --
L60846 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
L60845 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Did you do it for Tim?
L60622 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ He's alive.
L60621 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Is he...
L60183 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
L60182 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
L60181 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ My Lt. might have something to say about that.
L60180 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
L60881 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
L60880 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
L60864 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
L60863 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ "You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
L60862 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
L60857 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Shut up!
L60856 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
L60836 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
L60835 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
L60834 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I'll handle it.
L60833 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What are we going to do about this?
L60832 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Anything else?
L60827 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
L60826 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- What were they doing there?
L60825 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
L60824 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ How do you know?
L60823 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I know.
L60822 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
L60821 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- What are you doing here?
L60820 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
L60819 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
L60818 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
L60817 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
L60816 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
L60815 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
L60814 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ ...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
L60813 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
L60812 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Everybody did.
L60811 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ When dad died, I saw another fire...
L60810 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Saw what?
L60809 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I saw it.
L60808 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
L60807 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ It's okay, Stephen, I --
L60806 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
L60805 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
L60804 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
L60803 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
L60802 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
L60801 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ You're selling dad's boat?
L60800 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
L60799 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ So hello.
L60798 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Just... Just wanted to say hello...
L60797 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Hey, what are you doing here?
L60632 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Fuck you.
L60631 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
L60630 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I had that fire. He didn't listen!
L60629 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
L60628 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ ...Not now, Brian.
L60468 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Just leave me alone, okay?
L60467 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Brian, look --
L60466 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Thanks for the insight.
L60465 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
L60369 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
L60368 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
L60367 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
L60366 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I waited... I would have fucking waited...
L60365 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You okay?
L60362 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
L60361 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
L60360 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Ready?
L60354 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Roll the hose.
L60353 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
L60352 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You got a problem with drilling, probie?
L60351 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
L60349 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What, are you kidding? By myself?
L60348 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Roll the hose.
L60317 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Yeah... too bright...
L60316 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ This?
L60315 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
L60311 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ C'mon, let's crawl home.
L60310 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
L60308 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
L60307 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
L60235 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hey.
L60234 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Hey.
L60233 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
L60232 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Thanks.
L60185 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- Never mind.
L60184 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
L60170 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
L60169 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
L60168 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- I told you to stay next to me!
L60167 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Goddamn it Stephen!
L60166 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
L60165 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- C'mon, Stephen.
L60164 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
L60138 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
L60137 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I'm in heaven, Lt.
L60136 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Ya love it, probie?
L60114 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
L60113 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
L60112 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
L60111 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
L60110 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Thanks for the speakers.
L60109 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
L60108 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
L60107 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
L60106 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
L60105 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hey! You don't know me --
L60104 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
L60103 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
L60102 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Why'd you come here, Brian?
L60101 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ That was never proved.
L60100 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah? What about Laura --
L60099 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Sheep don't count.
L60098 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
L60097 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ People actually used to pay you for this?
L60096 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ It worked when you were in sixth grade.
L60095 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ It works.
L60094 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ In the Field Museum once.
L60093 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ What, you've never seen one before?
L60092 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ My God, an actual operating 8-track.
L60090 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
L60089 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Been ripping off fire stations?
L60088 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ It's comin' along... want a beer?
L60087 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I like what you've done with the place.
L60054 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
L60053 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Not likely.
L60052 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
L60051 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
L60050 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
L60049 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
L59962 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
L59961 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Who asked you?
L59960 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ It doesn't go like that.
L60908 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ It's a small town.
L60907 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I'll see ya around, huh?
L60906 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I don't have the slightest idea...
L60905 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What'll you do?
L60904 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I quit two days ago, Brian.
L60903 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
L60746 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ You're right.
L60745 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ That's a dumb thing to say.
L60744 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L60743 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Just take it.
L60742 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What is --
L60720 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
L60719 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
L60718 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yes.
L60717 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Do you know what you're asking me to do?
L60716 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ You could check. It'd be in his files.
L60715 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I don't know anything about it.
L60714 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
L60713 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
L60712 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hi.
L60711 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hi.
L60647 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
L60646 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- I work for the city.
L60645 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
L60644 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Leave Stephen out of this --
L60643 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
L60642 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
L60641 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I was doing my job.
L60640 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
L60639 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
L60638 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
L60637 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
L60636 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
L60635 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Brian. What's wrong?
L60591 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Uh huh.
L60590 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
L60587 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I wanted to be a good one.
L60586 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Then why did you quit?
L60585 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
L60584 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
L60583 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
L60582 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Homey.
L60581 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
L60580 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
L60579 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Got anything to drink in there?
L60578 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Thanks for the invite.
L60576 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
L60575 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
L60574 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
L60573 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
L60572 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
L60571 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
L60570 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Okay.
L60564 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
L60563 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Well, you did invite me here.
L60562 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You think that's really any of your business?
L60561 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
L60560 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
L60559 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
L60558 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hi.
L60542 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
L60541 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I could use a date.
L60540 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
L60539 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
L60538 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
L60537 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ How's it going?
L60536 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hey.
L60535 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
L60534 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Arson.
L60377 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah...
L60376 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ ...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
L60375 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
L60284 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
L60283 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
L60282 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ So now you suddenly care about my future?
L60281 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
L60280 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
L60279 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
L60252 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
L60251 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
L60250 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
L60247 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
L60246 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
L60245 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
L60244 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
L60243 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
L60242 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
L60241 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
L60240 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
L60239 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ When I was twenty.
L60238 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ With grenadine, right?
L60040 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
L60039 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
L60035 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
L60034 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Really? No kidding.
L60033 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I work for city hall.
L60032 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah? What have you been up to?
L60031 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
L60030 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
L60029 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Huh.
L60028 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
L60027 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Thanks for calling.
L60026 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ You look great.
L60025 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You're back.
L60024 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Jennifer.
L60023 +++$+++ u417 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Brian.
L60795 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
L60794 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Oh Jesus Christ...
L60790 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
L60789 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Who the fuck is doing this?
L60788 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
L60787 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Trychticholorate.
L60786 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
L60785 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ The outlets.
L60784 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
L60783 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
L60782 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
L60781 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
L60780 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
L60779 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What?
L60778 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
L60777 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Sure you do.
L60776 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I don't have a story.
L60775 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ -- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
L60774 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Then who --
L60773 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
L60772 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Who's doing this?
L60771 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
L60770 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
L60769 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
L60398 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hey, do I know you?
L60397 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
L59997 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ See you Monday. Sir.
L59996 +++$+++ u413 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ CHIEF FITZGERALD +++$+++ Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
L59995 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
L59994 +++$+++ u413 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ CHIEF FITZGERALD +++$+++ Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
L59993 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I need another one, sir.
L59992 +++$+++ u413 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ CHIEF FITZGERALD +++$+++ -- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
L59991 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
L59990 +++$+++ u413 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ CHIEF FITZGERALD +++$+++ Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
L59989 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I want another shot, Sir.
L59988 +++$+++ u413 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ CHIEF FITZGERALD +++$+++ You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
L59987 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
L60893 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Like it never happened...
L60892 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
L60891 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L60890 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Your brother was a good man.
L60767 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
L60766 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ So what do you want me to do?
L60765 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
L60764 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Just wondering.
L60763 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ No.
L60762 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Did I say thanks?
L60761 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Yeah.
L60760 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Did you pull me out?
L60759 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ How ya feeling?
L60758 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
L60754 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
L60753 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Then who wrote the report?
L60752 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
L60751 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
L60750 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah? Airtight?
L60749 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
L60709 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
L60708 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Nice bunch of guys.
L60707 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
L60706 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
L60705 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
L60704 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
L60672 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Fire.
L60671 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
L60665 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
L60664 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ What the hell are you doing here?
L60557 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
L60556 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Are you going public with this?
L60555 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
L60554 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
L60553 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
L60552 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What reason?
L60551 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
L60550 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ But he killed these guys.
L60549 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
L60548 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What?
L60547 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
L60533 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I don't work for them, either.
L60532 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
L60531 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I don't guess.
L60530 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ But the right guess on this is arson.
L60529 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
L60528 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ And the putty around the door?
L60527 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
L60526 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
L60525 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
L60524 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
L60523 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ "During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
L60522 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ -- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
L60521 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ "Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
L60520 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Read.
L60512 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
L60511 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
L60445 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ No it couldn't.
L60444 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
L60441 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- Another backdraft.
L60440 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
L60439 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
L60438 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Glass?
L60437 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
L60434 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What are you listening to?
L60433 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ -- Shhh.
L60388 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Pest control.
L60387 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Where are you going?
L60386 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
L60385 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
L60384 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
L60383 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
L60382 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Are you still here?
L60381 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
L60380 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
L60083 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
L60082 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Oh, man, I'm sorry.
L60081 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
L60080 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
L60078 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
L60077 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
L60076 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
L60075 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
L60073 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
L60072 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Four months?
L60071 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Four months.
L60070 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ 'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
L60069 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You look like... Brian.
L60068 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
L60067 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Brian?
L60649 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
L60648 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
L60567 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
L60566 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Nice boat.
L60565 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Mr. McCaffrey...
L60277 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
L60276 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
L60275 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
L60274 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I have a job.
L60273 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
L60272 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Every little boy's fantasy.
L60271 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ -- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
L60270 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
L60269 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ No need to be modest, Brian.
L60268 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
L60267 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
L60266 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah. Big fan.
L60454 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Swayzak's not my boss.
L60453 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
L60452 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ So, you surviving without me?
L60260 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ "Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
L60259 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What?
L60215 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
L60214 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
L60213 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
L60212 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Do you have to do that?
L60048 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Backdraft.
L60047 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
L60020 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
L60019 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
L60018 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
L60017 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
L60016 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
L60015 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Engine 115, right?
L60014 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Aren't you even curious?
L60000 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ What the hell are we waiting for?
L59999 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Completely out of control.
L60013 +++$+++ u424 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"...
L60012 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I was ahead of my time.
L60011 +++$+++ u424 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
L60010 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Coffee sucked.
L60009 +++$+++ u424 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ "Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
L60008 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Management were pin heads.
L60007 +++$+++ u424 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
L60006 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
L60005 +++$+++ u424 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
L60004 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ It's in my blood, Willy.
L60003 +++$+++ u424 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
L59979 +++$+++ u414 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
L59978 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Dad!
L59973 +++$+++ u414 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Cute.
L59972 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Firehouse.
L59971 +++$+++ u414 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
L59970 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Fireman shit?
L59967 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ And DIE!
L59966 +++$+++ u414 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
L59965 +++$+++ u414 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Well, let's have a look.
L59964 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
L59963 +++$+++ u414 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Who's going to die?
L60831 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I'll be there, goddamn it!
L60830 +++$+++ u415 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ GRINDLE +++$+++ They're waitin' man.
L60829 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I'll be there.
L60828 +++$+++ u415 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ GRINDLE +++$+++ We gotta roll, Stevie...
L60692 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
L60691 +++$+++ u415 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ GRINDLE +++$+++ He just wants to --
L60690 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I'm busy.
L60689 +++$+++ u415 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ GRINDLE +++$+++ Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
L60124 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
L60123 +++$+++ u415 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ GRINDLE +++$+++ I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
L60730 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
L60729 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
L60728 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ -- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
L60727 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Look, I'm sorry I --
L60726 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
L60725 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
L60724 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
L60723 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What's wrong?
L60722 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
L60499 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You can't keep being his father...
L60498 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
L60497 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yeah? When was the last time?
L60496 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
L60495 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
L60494 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
L60493 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I know he's out, but how's he doing?
L60492 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ He's out.
L60491 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
L60490 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
L60489 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You want some coffee?
L60488 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You treated me like shit.
L60487 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I treated you better.
L60486 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Okay.
L60485 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ He treats you okay?
L60484 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
L60483 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Sorry I hit Jackson.
L60482 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ The great communicator.
L60481 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
L60480 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ -- You remember.
L60479 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
L60478 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
L60477 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
L60476 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He's going to be a fireman.
L60475 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Oh yeah? How's he doing?
L60474 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He's got piano lessons.
L60473 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Where's Sean?
L60472 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It's not your roof anymore.
L60471 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Fixing my roof.
L60470 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Stephen, what are you doing here?
L60299 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Here we go...
L60298 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You can't talk about my brother like that...
L60291 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
L60290 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
L60518 +++$+++ u418 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RICCO +++$+++ That's your job.
L60517 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ What the hell was it doing in the fire?
L60516 +++$+++ u418 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RICCO +++$+++ Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
L60515 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
L60514 +++$+++ u418 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RICCO +++$+++ See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
L60510 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ McCaffrey, hold this for us.
L60509 +++$+++ u418 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RICCO +++$+++ Anyway, down here, take a look...
L60506 +++$+++ u418 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RICCO +++$+++ There's something else kinda interesting...
L60505 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Putty? On both doors?
L60504 +++$+++ u418 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RICCO +++$+++ They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
L60427 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ -- Burn it all.
L60426 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ And the world -- the whole world.
L60425 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ -- Burn them.
L60424 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ And old ladies?
L60423 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ -- Burn them.
L60419 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Absolutely.
L60418 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
L60407 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
L60406 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Nobody cares, Ronald.
L60405 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Did he tell you how we finally met?
L60404 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
L60403 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Tell him about me, Shadow?
L60402 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Knock it off. Now.
L60400 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ I know you.
L60399 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ You don't know him.
L60396 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ You like everybody, Ronald.
L60395 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
L60394 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ He works for me.
L60393 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Who's this?
L60392 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
L60391 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Didn't think you'd make it.
L60390 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
L60389 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Shadow.
L60702 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I need that report, Lt.
L60701 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ It knows us. This one knows us.
L60700 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I might.
L60699 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You don't know... nobody knows...
L60698 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ What do you listen to, Stephen?
L60697 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ ...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
L60696 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
L60695 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I'm working on it.
L60058 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
L60057 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
L60056 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Got a cause?
L60898 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
L60897 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ I'm a little busy right now --
L60896 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Investigator...
L60895 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
L60663 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Just catch the son of a bitch.
L60662 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
L60661 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
L60660 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
L60659 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
L60658 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ No Marty, I don't.
L60657 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Don't you have any leads at all?
L60656 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ "Don?"
L60655 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
L60653 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Alderman.
L60652 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Inspector.
L60188 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I need to get in the trunk.
L60187 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Investigator Rimgale.
L60186 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Alderman Swayzak.
L61942 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ I'm a Catholic.
L61941 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
L61940 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to --
L61939 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ "The Strawberries"?
L61938 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
L61937 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ You mean you could use it.
L61936 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
L61935 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him.
L61934 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ Who?
L61933 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
L61919 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.

L61916 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ Then c'mere. I got something for you.

L61911 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
L61904 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ Why?
L61903 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!
L61825 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
L61824 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Yeah.
L61823 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
L61822 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ People.
L61820 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
L61819 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ What's to believe?
L61818 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
L61817 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
L61813 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
L61812 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.

L61807 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ Susie's not a virgin anymore.
L61806 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
L61805 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
L61751 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
L61750 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
L61730 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
L61729 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
L61728 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
L61984 +++$+++ u427 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ FENCE +++$+++ That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in,  You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand?  No. How could you understand.
L61983 +++$+++ u426 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN +++$+++ He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
L61982 +++$+++ u427 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ FENCE +++$+++ So what are you doing here?
L61979 +++$+++ u427 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ FENCE +++$+++ I was gonna bring it back myself.

L61725 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
L61724 +++$+++ u428 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JC +++$+++ The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
L61723 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
L61722 +++$+++ u428 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JC +++$+++ That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
L61964 +++$+++ u429 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JESUS +++$+++ I forgive you.
L61963 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
L61962 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
L61961 +++$+++ u429 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JESUS +++$+++ I forgive you.
L61960 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
L61959 +++$+++ u429 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JESUS +++$+++ I forgive you.
L61958 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
L61957 +++$+++ u429 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JESUS +++$+++ I forgive you.
L61956 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
L61955 +++$+++ u429 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JESUS +++$+++ I forgive you.
L61954 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
L61953 +++$+++ u429 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JESUS +++$+++ I forgive you.
L61952 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Me?
L61951 +++$+++ u429 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JESUS +++$+++ I forgive you.
L61932 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
L61931 +++$+++ u430 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LARGE +++$+++ Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
L61929 +++$+++ u430 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LARGE +++$+++ OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message.

L61928 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!

He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
L61884 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ That 50 G could help you --
L61883 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.

L61851 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.

L61715 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
L61714 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ How about 7 1/2?
L61713 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ I want 15 on the Mets.
L61712 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ All right. What are you gonna do?
L61711 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
L61864 +++$+++ u434 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
L61863 +++$+++ u433 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
L61862 +++$+++ u433 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
L61861 +++$+++ u434 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Yes, Sister?
L61860 +++$+++ u433 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
L61859 +++$+++ u434 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
L61858 +++$+++ u433 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
L61857 +++$+++ u434 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
L61856 +++$+++ u433 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
L61855 +++$+++ u434 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
L61854 +++$+++ u433 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
L63586 +++$+++ u435 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ 1/16TH BLACK +++$+++ Yo Black, you looking for trouble.

L62740 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
L62739 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Please.
L62738 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
L62737 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Who are you revolting against?
L62736 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
L62735 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
L62734 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
L62733 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
L62732 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
L62731 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
L62730 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
L62729 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
L62728 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
L62727 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ Give me some?
L62726 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Well you did.
L62725 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ I didn't mean to scare you like that.
L62724 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
L62979 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.

L62977 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop science.
L62976 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
L62975 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
L62974 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ What's your name?
L62973 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
L63481 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
L63480 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
L63476 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ I'm a revolutionary.
L63475 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ What do you do?

L63468 +++$+++ u437 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ BIG BLACK +++$+++ Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
L63467 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
L63431 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
L63430 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
L63429 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ You can walk away.  We both can.
L63428 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
L63427 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ You're in this up till ya neck.
L63426 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Damn skippy.
L63425 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ So that's what you been doing?
L63424 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
L63423 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ I'm out.
L63422 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Meaning?
L63421 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
L63420 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ What are you talkin' about?
L63419 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
L63254 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Look at my lips.
L63253 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Why they gotta make my nose so big?
L62898 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
L62897 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
L62896 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Please, have a seat.
L62891 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Must be the pressure.
L62890 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ What's wrong with him?
L62881 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ You ain't happy about the green light?
L62880 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ DeLa - what's the matter with you.
L62833 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
L62832 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
L62831 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
L62830 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Seconds and thirds, too.
L62829 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
L62828 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ What's that?
L62827 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ She's also moorish.
L62826 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Certified ladies' man, huh?
L62825 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
L62824 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
L62823 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
L62822 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I'm not smiling.
L62821 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Why are you smiling so?
L62820 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ You might be right.
L62819 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
L62845 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ That can be done.
L62844 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ We might need some mo' money behind this.
L62843 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
L62757 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ And this is Manray.
L62756 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Nice to meet you.
L62701 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
L62700 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
L62695 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Different.
L62694 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ What kind of show is this gonna be?
L62690 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
L62689 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ How much?
L62688 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
L62682 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Manray needs a job.
L62681 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ No offense.
L62680 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
L62679 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
L62562 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
L62561 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ De-la-croix.
L62560 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
L62559 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Good morning, Cheeba.
L62842 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
L62841 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ That ain't funny.
L62686 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ We're starving.
L62685 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
L62684 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ We was coming to see you.
L62683 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
L62646 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
L62645 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
L62629 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ I'm tired of waiting.
L62628 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
L62627 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ And I'm the feet.
L62626 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
L62625 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
L62624 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Ahh, the luxuries of life.
L62622 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ Did we get our bill yet?
L62621 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
L62620 +++$+++ u438 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ CHEEBA +++$+++ My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
L62619 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ I'm starvin' like Marvin.
L63568 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ No costume.  No blackface.
L63567 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
L63566 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
L63565 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ I won't do it anymore.
L63564 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ How you sound?
L63563 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
L62847 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Mantan!!
L62846 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ Mantan?
L62836 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You have to start getting into your character.
L62835 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ Why?
L62834 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
L62706 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
L62705 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You're now Mantan.
L62704 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ To what?
L62703 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I would like to change your name.
L62699 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
L62698 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
L62697 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
L62696 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ How different?
L62693 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ Where do I sign?
L62692 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Some tap dancing, some singing.
L62691 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ What do I have to do?
L62637 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ EUREKA!!
L62636 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ My tap shoes.
L62566 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ Well do something about it.
L62565 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
L63326 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 
L63325 +++$+++ u442 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ GARY BYRD +++$+++ Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
L63324 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
L63323 +++$+++ u442 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ GARY BYRD +++$+++ But the line has to be drawn.
L63322 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
L63321 +++$+++ u442 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ GARY BYRD +++$+++ No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
L63320 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
L63319 +++$+++ u442 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ GARY BYRD +++$+++ Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
L63097 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
L63096 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I gots to go, it's my Moms.
L63095 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
L63094 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Hold on a sec, I got a call.
L63093 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
L63092 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ This has to be a big mistake.
L63091 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
L63090 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
L63023 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
L63022 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
L63021 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
L63020 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
L63018 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Calm down, please.
L63017 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
L62997 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Dunwitty, don't leave.
L62996 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
L62935 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
L62934 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
L62933 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
L62932 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
L62931 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
L62930 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
L62929 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
L62928 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
L62927 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
L62926 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
L62925 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
L62924 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
L62923 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
L62922 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
L62812 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
L62811 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ We think so.
L62810 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
L62800 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
L62799 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I don't know about that plantation angle.
L62798 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
L62797 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama. 
L62796 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
L62795 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
L62794 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
L62793 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Who are the other characters?
L62792 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
L62791 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
L62790 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Negroes would be in an uproar.
L62789 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
L62788 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
L62787 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
L62786 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Yep, you guessed it.
L62785 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
L62784 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
L62783 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Exactly!
L62782 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
L62781 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ What are there character traits?
L62780 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
L62779 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back.
L62778 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
L62777 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ That's a great handle.
L62774 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
L62773 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
L62772 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
L62771 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
L62770 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I'm feelin' dis'!
L62769 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
L62768 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
L62767 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ The name of the show?
L62766 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
L62765 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Word!!!
L62764 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
L62763 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Go on.  Good so far.
L62762 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
L62761 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I'm wid it.
L62760 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
L62753 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
L62752 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
L62618 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
L62617 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
L62616 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
L62615 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
L62614 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
L62613 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
L62612 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
L62611 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I've never been given a fair shot.
L62610 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
L62609 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ ...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
L62608 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
L62607 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I'm telling you it's not.
L62606 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
L62605 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
L62602 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
L62601 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
L62600 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
L62599 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
L62598 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
L62597 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
L62595 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
L62594 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Do you know what C.P. Time is?
L62578 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
L62577 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
L62576 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Four minutes ago.
L62575 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
L62574 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
L62573 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I'm sorry I'm late.
L62572 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ ...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
L63170 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Always keep 'em laughing.
L63169 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I love you too, Daddy.
L63168 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
L63167 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Let's get him over to the bed.
L63164 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
L63163 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I didn't mean that, in life.
L63162 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
L63161 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Where do you go from here?
L63160 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
L63159 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Nuthin' I can't handle.
L63158 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
L63157 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
L63156 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Enough about me, what's happening with you?
L63155 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
L63154 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
L63153 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
L63152 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.
L63151 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
L63150 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ That's what I'm askin'.
L63149 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
L63148 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ How did you end up here?
L63147 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
L63146 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
L63145 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Purely for medicinal purposes.
L63144 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
L63143 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Daddy, she's younger than me.
L63142 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Good woman.  I trained her right.
L63137 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Pleased to meet you.
L63136 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
L63135 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It's been a long time.
L63134 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
L63133 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It's me, Peerless.
L63132 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ Go away, unless you got my money.
L63131 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I want to speak with you.
L63130 +++$+++ u445 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUNEBUG +++$+++ What do you want?
L63180 +++$+++ u440 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DOT +++$+++ He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
L63179 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ He never showed it.
L63178 +++$+++ u440 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DOT +++$+++ Your father is proud of you.
L63177 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
L63176 +++$+++ u440 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DOT +++$+++ I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
L63175 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ So what's up with you?
L63174 +++$+++ u440 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DOT +++$+++ The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
L63173 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ So he drank himself into a stuper?
L63172 +++$+++ u440 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DOT +++$+++ Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
L63171 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ How long has my father been like this?
L63139 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Is that so?
L63138 +++$+++ u440 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DOT +++$+++ Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
L63659 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Give me the gun.
L63658 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
L63655 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
L63654 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Don't make me have to use this.
L63504 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ And that's how you got me in the first place.
L63503 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
L63502 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
L63501 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Work related or otherwise?
L63500 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
L63499 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
L63498 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ That's why it will be so much fun.
L63497 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ This is crazy.
L63496 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
L63495 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
L63494 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Light?
L63493 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
L63492 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Do you have to be so damn forthright?
L63491 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
L63490 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
L63489 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Please don't go there.
L63488 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
L63487 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ He's just playing big brother.
L63486 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
L63485 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
L63484 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
L63483 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I don't want to hear it.
L63482 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Why'd you do that?
L63318 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
L63317 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ How so?
L63316 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
L63315 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Is that good or bad?
L63314 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I thought it was appropiate.
L63313 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Thanks.
L63312 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
L63311 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ The Jolly Nigger Bank.
L63307 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
L63306 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ For what?
L63305 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ A gift.
L63304 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ What is this?
L63303 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
L63302 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ So you have your small victory, now what?
L63251 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Everybody shut up.
L63250 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
L63247 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
L63246 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Who's side are you on?
L63060 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
L63059 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
L63053 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ The pleasure is mine.
L63052 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Same here.
L63047 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Just don't lie to me.
L63046 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ What do you want me to say?
L63045 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ We both lied to him.
L63044 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
L63043 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Your life will never be the same.
L63025 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Break a leg.
L63024 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Just want to say good luck.
L63015 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
L63014 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You've said that already.
L62971 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ The big one.
L62970 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Which one is your brother?
L62969 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ This is the group I was telling you about.
L62938 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired. 
L62937 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Hello.
L62936 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
L62920 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
L62919 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
L62918 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
L62917 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
L62913 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
L62912 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
L62911 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
L62910 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
L62909 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ What is your problem?
L62879 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
L62878 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You okay?
L62755 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ This is Cheeba.
L62754 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Hello.
L62667 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
L62666 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
L62659 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
L62658 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
L62657 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Good.  I'm going to need your support.
L62656 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I'm in till the end.
L62655 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You getting cold feet?
L62654 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Sounds risky to me.
L62653 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
L62652 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ What point is that?
L62651 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
L62650 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You lost me.
L62649 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
L62648 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Do you know how you will use him?
L62647 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Manray was under our nose the whole time.
L62644 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
L62643 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
L62642 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ It hit me like a ton of bricks.
L62641 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ How did you know?
L62640 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Manray!
L62639 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Manray!
L62593 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
L62592 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
L62591 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Nobody told me anything.
L62590 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
L62589 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ How was it?
L62951 +++$+++ u448 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MONA +++$+++ I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
L62950 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
L62949 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.
L62944 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Oh, is that what I'm doing?
L62943 +++$+++ u448 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MONA +++$+++ I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
L62942 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Hi, Mona.
L62941 +++$+++ u448 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MONA +++$+++ He, I'm Mona.
L62940 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Yes, your name?
L63562 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.
L63561 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ My name is Manray, goddamnit.
L63560 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Mantan, we got a show to tape.
L63512 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
L63511 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L63510 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
L63509 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
L63508 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
L63507 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ What you did is dead wrong.
L63506 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
L63453 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
L63452 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L63451 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
L63450 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
L63449 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
L63448 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ No.
L63447 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
L63350 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ In time.
L63349 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
L63348 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ No joke.  Serious.
L63345 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
L63344 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Same thing Giuliani said.
L63343 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
L63342 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ You sound like the media.
L63341 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ So they can be on TV.
L63032 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
L63031 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Not nervous?  Relaxed?
L63030 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I feel fine.
L63029 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You feel good, not nervous?
L63028 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Naw.  I'll take the zero.
L63027 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Can I kiss you too?
L62889 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
L62888 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
L62887 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
L62886 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I didn't mean it to sound like that.
L62885 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
L62884 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
L63545 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Soon.
L63544 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
L63543 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
L63542 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ You know how your Daddy is.
L63541 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Not at all?
L63540 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ No.
L63539 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
L63538 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
L63537 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
L63536 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
L63118 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Peerless, last time, go see your father.
L63117 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
L63116 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
L63115 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
L63114 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Regardless, he still is your father.
L63113 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
L63112 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Richmond is not all the way down south.
L63111 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I can't go all the way down south.
L63110 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
L63109 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Where is he?
L63108 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Yes he did.
L63107 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ He said that?
L63106 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ He wants you to come and see him.
L63099 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I'll be right over.
L63098 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Peerless, your father called.
L62877 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
L62876 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
L62875 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
L62874 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
L62873 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
L62872 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
L62871 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
L62870 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Mommy, please don't call me that.
L62869 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
L62868 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
L62867 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
L62866 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
L62865 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ How's the food?
L62864 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
L62863 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
L62862 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
L62861 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It looks delicious.
L62860 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ You must think I'm some kind of fool.
L63049 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
L63048 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
L63013 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ This is a travesty.  A debacle.
L63012 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
L63011 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ This is a TV show, not a music video.
L63010 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
L63009 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ How did you get this gig?
L63008 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
L63007 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
L63006 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
L63005 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
L63004 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
L63003 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ What's a Negro.
L63002 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
L63001 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
L63000 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Finland.
L62999 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
L62998 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Where are you from?
L62995 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ I just turned twenty.
L62994 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
L63300 +++$+++ u449 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MYRNA +++$+++ This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
L63299 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Yes you!
L63295 +++$+++ u449 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MYRNA +++$+++ Thank you.  And always smile.
L63294 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Let Myrna finish.
L63289 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
L63288 +++$+++ u449 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MYRNA +++$+++ The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
L63282 +++$+++ u449 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MYRNA +++$+++ The best defense is offense.
L63281 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
L63278 +++$+++ u449 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MYRNA +++$+++ First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
L63277 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
L62722 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
L62721 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
L62720 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
L62719 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
L62718 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
L62717 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
L62716 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
L62715 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
L62714 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L62713 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ So what's up with you and DeLa?
L62712 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
L62711 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ You sing and dance?
L62710 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
L62709 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
L62708 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You've never had any formal training, either?
L62707 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ I never had a really real pair before.
L63466 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS. 
L63465 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
L63464 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
L63463 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
L63462 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
L63461 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
L63460 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ Money and nothing else?
L63459 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
L63458 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
L63457 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I'm more comfortable around my people.
L63456 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
L63455 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Tavis, thank you for having me.
L63454 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
L63399 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ A song a comin' I feel.

L63396 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
L63395 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
L63394 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. 
L63393 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
L63392 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I don't know who I am.

L63388 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
L63387 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
L63386 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
L63385 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
L63384 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I slept too near where I fell out.
L63383 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ You slept too near where you got in?
L63382 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I fell out of my bed last night.

Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
L63084 +++$+++ u451 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLEEP 'N EAT +++$+++ Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.

L63531 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I know I won't be your puppet.
L63530 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Why don't you answer?
L63529 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Don't try to change to the subject.
L63528 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
L63527 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
L63526 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
L63525 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Aw, c'mon.
L63524 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
L63523 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
L63522 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Say what, Manray?
L63521 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Oh, you gonna make me say it.
L63520 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Just ask me what you want to know.
L63519 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Stop playing me Sloan.
L63518 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ And what?
L63517 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ And?
L63516 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
L63515 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ You leave something out?
L63514 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
L63513 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ How did you get this gig?
L63441 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ You look beautiful like that.
L63440 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ What?
L63439 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Y'know what?
L63438 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
L63436 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ My people love me.
L63435 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You're sure this is a good idea.
L63434 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ For what?  He left.  Not me.
L63433 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Why don't you call him?
L63380 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ We can look out for ourselves.
L63379 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
L63378 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
L63377 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
L63376 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
L63375 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Maybe you need to start.
L63374 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Never read a book in my whole life.
L63373 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You don't read, do you?
L63372 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ No, before my time.
L63371 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
L63370 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Gots no intention of ending up broke.
L63369 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
L63368 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Just a little something' somethin'.
L63367 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Oh you do, huh?
L63366 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
L63365 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
L63105 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Are you trying to rap to me?
L63104 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ What else?
L63103 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
L63102 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ The good stuff.
L63101 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ What do you want to know?
L63100 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ So what's up with you?
L62904 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Enough.
L62903 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ A lot?
L62883 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
L62882 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
L64606 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
L64605 +++$+++ u454 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ ARMED GENTLEMAN +++$+++ Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
L64604 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ That is none of your business.
L64603 +++$+++ u454 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ ARMED GENTLEMAN +++$+++ Where are you bound for?
L64602 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Good morning.
L64601 +++$+++ u454 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ ARMED GENTLEMAN +++$+++ Good day to you, young sir.
L64575 +++$+++ u463 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
L64574 +++$+++ u455 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN BEST +++$+++ Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
L64573 +++$+++ u463 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
L64530 +++$+++ u463 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
L64529 +++$+++ u455 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN BEST +++$+++ I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
L64528 +++$+++ u463 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Both of us ride home with Best here.
L64524 +++$+++ u463 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
L64523 +++$+++ u455 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN BEST +++$+++ And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
L64501 +++$+++ u455 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN BEST +++$+++ I never was more in earnest.
L64500 +++$+++ u466 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
L64499 +++$+++ u455 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN BEST +++$+++ It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
L64498 +++$+++ u466 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
L64497 +++$+++ u455 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN BEST +++$+++ I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
L64496 +++$+++ u466 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
L64828 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
L64827 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ And his baggage?
L64826 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
L64823 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
L64822 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Has he sent the challenge yet?
L64808 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
L64807 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ What are the Chevalier's intentions?
L64769 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
L64768 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Only a very little, as soldiers do.
L64767 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
L64764 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
L64763 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ What is the service, sir?
L64762 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
L64761 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
L64760 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ How do you do, sir?
L64759 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
L64742 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Neither!
L64741 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
L64740 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Sir, I'm a British officer.
L64739 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ I have acted as I think fit.
L64738 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
L64737 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
L64736 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Where's the beauty you promised me?
L64733 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
L64732 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
L64731 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
L64730 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
L64729 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
L64728 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
L64726 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
L64725 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ O'Grady.
L64724 +++$+++ u456 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ What is your uncle's name?
L64723 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
L64692 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
L64691 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ The coward!
L64690 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
L64689 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
L64688 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
L64687 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
L64686 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
L64685 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Is Miss Dugan well?
L64684 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
L64683 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
L64682 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
L64681 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
L64680 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
L64572 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
L64571 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
L64563 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ It must have been some other gate.
L64562 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
L64561 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
L64560 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I'll match any man with the sword.
L64559 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
L64558 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
L64557 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
L64556 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
L64555 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
L64554 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ That's a very handsome sword you have there.
L64552 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ Your cousins go out with him.
L64551 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
L64550 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
L64549 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Have you taken my message to him?
L64540 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
L64539 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
L64538 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
L64537 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
L64536 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
L64535 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ And so I am.
L64534 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
L64510 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
L64509 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
L64506 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
L64505 +++$+++ u457 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN GROGAN +++$+++ This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
L64661 +++$+++ u458 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN O'REILLY +++$+++ Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
L64660 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
L64659 +++$+++ u458 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN O'REILLY +++$+++ You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
L64658 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
L64657 +++$+++ u458 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN O'REILLY +++$+++ Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
L64639 +++$+++ u458 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN O'REILLY +++$+++ I have heard of them.
L64638 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
L64637 +++$+++ u458 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN O'REILLY +++$+++ Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
L64636 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
L64635 +++$+++ u458 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN O'REILLY +++$+++ Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
L64634 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
L64633 +++$+++ u458 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CAPTAIN O'REILLY +++$+++ Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
L64803 +++$+++ u471 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PRINCE +++$+++ I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
L64802 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
L64801 +++$+++ u471 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PRINCE +++$+++ Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
L64800 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
L64799 +++$+++ u471 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PRINCE +++$+++ I don't know.
L64798 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
L64797 +++$+++ u471 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PRINCE +++$+++ Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
L64843 +++$+++ u472 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PRUSSIAN OFFICER +++$+++ The gentleman has nothing contraband.
L64842 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ I have no luggage.
L64839 +++$+++ u472 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PRUSSIAN OFFICER +++$+++ As you please.
L64838 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ All Europe shall hear of this!
L64837 +++$+++ u472 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PRUSSIAN OFFICER +++$+++ Your honor must lower his voice.
L64836 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
L64835 +++$+++ u472 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PRUSSIAN OFFICER +++$+++ I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
L64834 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
L64833 +++$+++ u472 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PRUSSIAN OFFICER +++$+++ You are going to drive to the frontier.
L64832 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ Good gracious!  What is this?
L64831 +++$+++ u472 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PRUSSIAN OFFICER +++$+++ I will let down the steps for your honor.
L64830 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
L64912 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
L64911 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ Certain?
L64910 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
L64909 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
L64908 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
L64874 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
L64873 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
L64845 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
L64844 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
L64819 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ But how, sir?
L64818 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
L64817 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
L64816 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ I have faced that problem before.
L64815 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I believe they will deport you.
L64814 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
L64813 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
L64792 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
L64791 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
L64790 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?
L64788 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
L64787 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
L64781 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Only the agency of servants.
L64780 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ Who else can give me information about you?
L64779 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
L64778 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ For whom else have you worked?
L64777 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
L64776 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
L64775 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L64774 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
L64773 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
L64772 +++$+++ u459 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ CHEVALIER +++$+++ You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
L64901 +++$+++ u460 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNT +++$+++ Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
L64900 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ That is a trifle strong.
L64899 +++$+++ u460 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNT +++$+++ Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
L64898 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
L64897 +++$+++ u460 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNT +++$+++ Then you yield to me.
L64896 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
L64895 +++$+++ u460 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNT +++$+++ Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
L64894 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
L64893 +++$+++ u460 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNT +++$+++ I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
L65194 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ Old fool!
L65193 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
L65164 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
L65163 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
L64992 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
L64991 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
L64990 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
L64989 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
L64986 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
L64985 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
L64984 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
L64983 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
L64982 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
L64981 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
L64980 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
L64979 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
L64978 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Will we always leave it at this?
L64977 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
L64976 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
L64975 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
L64974 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
L64973 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
L64972 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
L64971 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
L64970 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
L64969 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
L64968 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
L64967 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
L64966 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
L64965 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ To make me wretched in two weeks.
L64964 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ It is my only object.
L64963 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ You want my heart?
L64962 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
L64961 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ How so?
L64960 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
L64959 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
L64958 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
L64957 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
L64956 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
L64955 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
L64954 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
L64953 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
L64952 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
L64951 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
L64950 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
L64949 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
L64948 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Have you not a man whom you value?
L64947 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ Not one.
L64946 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
L64945 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ Not even that.
L64944 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ But, for a time... a passing fancy?
L64943 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ Never.
L64942 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Have you had one?
L64941 +++$+++ u461 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ COUNTESS +++$+++ No.
L64494 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
L64493 +++$+++ u462 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
L64472 +++$+++ u462 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
L64471 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
L64470 +++$+++ u462 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
L64469 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
L64468 +++$+++ u462 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
L64467 +++$+++ u462 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
L64466 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
L64465 +++$+++ u462 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
L64464 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ But you refused me, Dorothy.
L64463 +++$+++ u462 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
L64462 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
L64461 +++$+++ u462 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
L64460 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
L64452 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
L64451 +++$+++ u462 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Why are you shaking?
L64450 +++$+++ u462 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Then you must get it.
L64449 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I feel the ribbon.
L64446 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.
L64445 +++$+++ u462 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Agreed.
L64444 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
L65079 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ All right, five hundred guineas.
L65078 +++$+++ u464 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ HENRI +++$+++ Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
L65075 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
L65074 +++$+++ u464 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ HENRI +++$+++ All the same, you must name an amount.
L65073 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
L65072 +++$+++ u464 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ HENRI +++$+++ As much as possible?
L65071 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ As much as possible.
L65070 +++$+++ u464 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ HENRI +++$+++ I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
L65103 +++$+++ u465 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ LORD WEST +++$+++ Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
L65102 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Yes!
L65101 +++$+++ u465 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ LORD WEST +++$+++ Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
L65048 +++$+++ u465 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ LORD WEST +++$+++ Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
L65047 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ By name only.
L65046 +++$+++ u465 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ LORD WEST +++$+++ Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
L65045 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
L64825 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ What is to be done?
L64824 +++$+++ u467 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MINISTER GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Then this must be done tomorrow.
L64821 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ When is he to go?
L64820 +++$+++ u467 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MINISTER GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
L64810 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ The Prince left him only that choice.
L64809 +++$+++ u467 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MINISTER GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
L64806 +++$+++ u467 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MINISTER GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Hmm-mmmm.
L64805 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
L64804 +++$+++ u467 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MINISTER GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Was he cheated?
L64771 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
L64770 +++$+++ u467 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MINISTER GALGENSTEIN +++$+++ Does this assignment interest you?
L64629 +++$+++ u468 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MRS. O'REILLY +++$+++ You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
L64628 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
L64627 +++$+++ u468 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MRS. O'REILLY +++$+++ That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
L64626 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
L64625 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
L64624 +++$+++ u468 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MRS. O'REILLY +++$+++ But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
L64623 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
L64622 +++$+++ u468 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MRS. O'REILLY +++$+++ That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
L64618 +++$+++ u468 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MRS. O'REILLY +++$+++ Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
L64617 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
L64614 +++$+++ u468 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ MRS. O'REILLY +++$+++ Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
L64613 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
L65179 +++$+++ u469 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ NEWCOMBE +++$+++ When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
L65178 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I see.
L65177 +++$+++ u469 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ NEWCOMBE +++$+++ Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
L65176 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Yes, of course.
L65175 +++$+++ u469 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ NEWCOMBE +++$+++ May I be quite frank with you?
L65174 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
L65173 +++$+++ u469 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ NEWCOMBE +++$+++ There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
L65172 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
L65171 +++$+++ u469 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ NEWCOMBE +++$+++ Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
L65170 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
L65169 +++$+++ u469 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ NEWCOMBE +++$+++ I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
L65146 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
L65145 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Yes, he's fine.
L65144 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Is he all right, papa?
L65143 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
L65133 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yes, papa.
L65132 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
L65127 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
L65126 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
L65125 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Yes?
L65124 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Papa?
L65123 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Good night, my little darling.
L65122 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Good night, papa.
L65120 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
L65119 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
L65118 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
L65117 +++$+++ u470 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Did you buy the horse, papa?
L65006 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
L65005 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Sir, let those laugh that win.
L65004 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
L65003 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
L65002 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
L65001 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
L65000 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
L64999 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
L64998 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
L64997 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert.
L64996 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
L64995 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L64994 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
L64993 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
L64936 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
L64935 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ The milkmaid's daughter?
L64934 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
L64933 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Would you have me spend my life all alone?
L64932 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.
L64930 +++$+++ u474 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ SIR WILLIAM +++$+++ Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
L64929 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
L64888 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Tender Hegenheim.
L64887 +++$+++ u475 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ VALDEZ +++$+++ He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
L64886 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Will he wish to know the details of this night?
L64885 +++$+++ u475 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ VALDEZ +++$+++ He loves me, as I love you.
L64884 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
L64883 +++$+++ u475 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ VALDEZ +++$+++ He is only curious to know who you are.
L64882 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ And he doesn't care about me?
L64881 +++$+++ u475 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ VALDEZ +++$+++ Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
L64880 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
L64879 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Dark Valdez.
L64878 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Black-eyed Sczortarska.
L64877 +++$+++ u473 +++$+++ m28 +++$+++ RODERICK +++$+++ Charming Schuvaloff.
L66030 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
L66029 +++$+++ u476 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Who?
L66028 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Bill Styles...
L66025 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
L66024 +++$+++ u476 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Hurricane kept you up, too?
L66023 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
L66022 +++$+++ u476 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
L66021 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah, if you've slept.
L66020 +++$+++ u476 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ It's ten thirty in the morning.
L66019 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Can I at least have a drink?
L66018 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You know that was like a quadruple negative?
L66017 +++$+++ u476 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ BARTENDER +++$+++ Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
L66621 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
L66620 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ You framed-him...
L66370 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
L66369 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ He is the only one unaccounted for.
L66344 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
L66343 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ What about Pike?
L66326 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
L66325 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Did -- did you --
L66322 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Fine.
L66321 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I don't want to go --
L66320 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
L66319 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ What do we do?
L66318 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
L66306 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
L66305 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
L66304 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
L66300 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I'm -- I'm sorry...
L66299 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Don't you ever point a gun at me!
L66619 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Shut up, Mueller.
L66618 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ West was one thing, but this --
L66341 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ HEY!
L66340 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
L66338 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ I don't know!
L66337 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
L66336 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ We got -- I don't know, we got separated
L66332 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
L66331 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ You killed him you fucking faggot --
L66330 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ We found him like this --
L66329 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
L66328 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Can anybody hear me!
L66327 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
L66617 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
L66616 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You too?
L66506 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Shut up.  West's dead.
L66505 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ Yeah, right...
L66484 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ We found him like this...
L66483 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
L66356 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ What do you mean, alone?
L66355 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
L66351 +++$+++ u477 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ CHILDS +++$+++ We don't know. West is dead.
L66350 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
L67044 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ He's telling the truth up to a point...
L67043 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
L67042 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
L66918 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
L66917 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And the bodies?
L66916 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
L66865 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
L66864 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Do what?
L66863 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ He -- He made me do it --
L66853 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Jesus!
L66852 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
L66848 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ We've found all of them.
L66847 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
L66846 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ We don't need the tapes --
L66824 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You wanna bet?
L66823 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ We're not finished yet --
L66635 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
L66634 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
L66629 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ But not Pike's.
L66628 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You saved Kendall's life --
L66627 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
L66626 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You shot Childs and Nunez.
L66479 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Yeah --
L66478 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And he'd been shot.
L66475 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Of course --
L66474 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You saw West's body.
L66473 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I apologize --
L66444 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah, we know, Pike did.
L66443 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I didn't shoot West --
L66442 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
L66437 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
L66436 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
L66435 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I'm serious --
L66434 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
L66433 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ He's lying.
L66432 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ That'd be my reaction too --
L66431 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ That son of a bitch.
L66430 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
L66200 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
L66199 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
L66198 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You smoke, Ray?
L66197 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
L66196 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
L66149 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Tell me about them.
L66148 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Some.
L66147 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
L66146 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I'm not telling you what happened.
L66145 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
L66136 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Okay.
L66135 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
L66129 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ They're dead, aren't they?
L66128 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ There's no need...
L66125 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
L66124 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You did Basic here?
L66123 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
L66122 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I don't know... I like the Army.
L66121 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ What do you like then?
L66120 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I just don't like it.
L66119 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
L66118 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ It's... too slow.
L66117 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
L66116 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I asked for a policeman.
L66115 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why not?
L66851 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
L66850 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ How do you know that?
L66849 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Ohhhh, I don't think so...
L66844 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
L66843 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
L66842 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
L66840 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Can't do that now, though, can you?
L66839 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
L66633 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
L66632 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Where's the cabin?
L66631 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Would you have believed me?
L66630 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
L66493 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Yeah.
L66492 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Mueller was alone in the cabin?
L66491 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Back up.
L66481 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
L66480 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What about the phosphorous grenade?
L66477 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ The creek bed --
L66476 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Where?
L66441 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
L66440 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What business?
L66439 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
L66438 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ He said he worked there --
L66195 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
L66194 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Epilepsy.
L66193 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
L66187 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ There were six of us...
L66186 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
L66185 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
L66183 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
L66182 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
L67009 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Your weapons, Sergeant.
L67008 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ What the fuck is going on?
L66172 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
L66171 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Sir, yes, sir!
L66170 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
L66169 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Sir, yes, sir!
L66168 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
L66167 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Sir, Dunbar, sir!
L66166 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ Cadet, what's your name!
L66614 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ I...
L66613 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ So you killed him?
L66495 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ So did we. Why didn't you come?
L66494 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
L66490 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ West... he's dead.
L66489 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Jesus, what happened?
L66373 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
L66372 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Why?
L66371 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
L66365 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
L66364 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
L66363 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ He wouldn't kill anybody...
L66604 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Put it down!
L66603 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
L66575 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
L66574 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
L66573 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
L66572 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
L66571 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ What don't you know?
L66570 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I... I don't know...
L66561 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
L66560 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ They?
L66559 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
L66557 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
L66556 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ His chest was hamburger --
L66555 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ From up close or far away?
L66554 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Full clip to the body --
L66553 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You saw West, right? How was he killed?
L66552 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
L66551 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
L66550 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Why... why didn't you tell me?
L66545 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
L66544 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You're lying --
L66543 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
L66542 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Just look. Little pocket.
L66541 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Why?
L66540 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Look in my pack.
L66539 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Bullshit.
L66538 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
L66537 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You hated West, Mueller loved him --
L66536 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
L66535 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ That's exactly what he says about you.
L66534 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
L66533 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Oh, come on --
L66532 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Mueller.
L66531 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ If not you, then who?
L66530 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
L66529 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
L66528 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You're the only one missing a grenade.
L66527 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
L66526 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You hated West more than any of us.
L66525 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
L66524 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Yeah...
L66523 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Right?
L66517 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Do I?
L66516 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You know it's not like that --
L66513 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Why?
L66512 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ We just want to check your pack --
L66511 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Roberto, what the fuck?
L66504 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
L66503 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Where have you been, Jay?
L66379 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
L66378 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ What do you mean, West's?
L66377 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ West's. Any kindling for afire?
L66376 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Whose blood is that, Jay?
L66753 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Maybe he...
L66752 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ MAYBE WHAT --
L66751 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Maybe --
L66750 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Where are they!
L66749 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I don't know --
L66748 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
L66747 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
L66746 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I didn't --
L66745 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
L66727 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Because I was standing next to him.
L66726 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ How do you know?
L66722 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
L66721 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why?
L66708 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I didn't do anything --
L66707 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
L66702 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
L66701 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Something funny, Levi?
L66692 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
L66691 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Dunbar will testify that you were.
L66689 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
L66688 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Well?
L66687 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
L66686 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
L66685 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ No. I said Dunbar.
L66684 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
L66683 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
L66682 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
L66679 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
L66678 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Is it the truth?
L66675 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ My heart weeps.
L66674 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
L66672 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
L66671 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
L66670 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
L66486 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Stop.
L66485 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
L66404 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Mr. Hardy?
L66403 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
L66402 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
L66401 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why did he come back for you?
L66381 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
L66380 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ He admitted it.
L66311 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ No. Poetic justice, though.
L66310 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ But you didn't.
L66309 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
L66294 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Then who did?
L66293 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I didn't kill him --
L66292 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ What happened to "degrees"?
L66291 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
L66290 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
L66262 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
L66261 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
L66260 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
L66259 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
L66258 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
L66244 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
L66243 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ But not the only victim, right?
L66242 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
L66241 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
L66240 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
L66239 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
L66238 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
L66980 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Get your hands away from the desk!
L66979 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
L66978 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
L66977 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ You're crazy --
L66976 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
L66975 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Not for long.
L66974 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
L66973 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
L66972 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ I'm not even going to dignify that --
L66971 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
L66970 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ I wanted to see if he was okay --
L66969 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
L66968 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ That's preposterous --
L66967 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
L66966 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
L66965 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Or what? You've gone round the bend --
L66964 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Stay where you are.
L66962 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
L66961 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ You're drunk --
L66960 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
L66959 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L66958 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
L66789 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
L66788 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You're a good soldier, Bill.
L66787 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
L66786 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Bill.
L66785 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ The Senator...
L66784 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ They're taking your command, aren't they?
L66781 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
L66780 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ You think you could explain all this to me?
L66778 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
L66777 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ That's horseshit and you know it.
L66776 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
L66654 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Does Osborne agree?
L66653 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L66652 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
L66651 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ What I said before --
L66455 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
L66454 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about --
L66453 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
L66452 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ What about the confession?
L66451 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Home, I'm done.
L66450 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Tom, where are you going --
L66429 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
L66428 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You mean not enough to save you.
L66427 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Not for me.
L66426 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
L66425 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Nevertheless --
L66424 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
L66423 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
L66422 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
L66421 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
L66420 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
L66419 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
L66408 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
L66407 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Who killed Pike?
L66406 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
L66205 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
L66204 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
L66073 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I'm not gonna let that happen.
L66072 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
L66071 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
L66070 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
L66069 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
L66066 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
L66065 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
L66064 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
L66063 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And the problem is you only got three.
L66062 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
L66058 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Well, he's a good soldier.
L66057 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
L66053 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
L66052 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
L66049 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
L66048 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
L66046 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Tell me what I can do.
L66045 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
L66044 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ That bad?
L66043 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ What kind of trouble are you in?
L66042 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
L66041 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ How are you?
L66996 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
L66995 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ He was your friend.
L66994 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
L66993 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Your phone number?
L66992 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Yeah.
L66991 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I should probably write that down.
L66990 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
L66989 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Want company?
L66988 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Nah.
L66987 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Think it'll work?
L66986 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
L66985 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
L66984 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What are you doing out here?
L66954 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
L66953 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Do I have a choice in this?
L66951 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
L66950 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ West?
L66946 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
L66945 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Really.
L66944 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You're a good man, Hardy.
L66943 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
L66942 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ That's not true.
L66939 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Tough.
L66938 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What if I don't want it?
L66937 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
L66936 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ This isn't the time --
L66934 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
L66933 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What?
L66932 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Seven.
L66931 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ We need to talk --
L66920 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ No death certificates. No crime.
L66919 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ No bodies, no West...
L66859 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
L66858 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Hardy, for Chrissakes --
L66857 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
L66855 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Isn't this how your story goes?
L66854 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Hardy, what are you doing --
L66832 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Right back where we started.
L66831 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
L66819 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Get in.
L66818 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Four --
L66803 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Good, just making sure.
L66802 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ No.
L66801 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
L66800 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ We were close to something with Kendall.
L66799 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ That's gonna stay my secret.
L66798 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ For what?
L66797 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
L66796 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You know, you never told me why you left the army.
L66795 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Nah.
L66794 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Think it'll work?
L66793 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
L66792 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ So what now?
L66775 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ So did I.
L66774 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L66773 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You wanted to break him.
L66772 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You mean the falsely accused?
L66771 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
L66770 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You wanted to get the truth.
L66769 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah, I could've. Should've.
L66768 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You couldn't have known --
L66767 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I pushed him too hard.
L66712 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
L66711 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ That's a fantastic idea --
L66704 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Good idea.
L66703 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
L66699 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
L66698 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Are you sure?
L66697 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
L66696 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ What?
L66695 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ They got their stories straight.
L66694 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ We're fucked, I know --
L66649 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Let's go talk to Bill...
L66648 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Little bit.
L66647 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ That bugs you too?
L66646 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
L66645 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
L66644 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Buttfucks the cabin?
L66643 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
L66642 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
L66641 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
L66640 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
L66639 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
L66638 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Dunbar.
L66637 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
L66636 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
L66499 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ What happened next?
L66498 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ At least you and Kendall agree on that.
L66472 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
L66471 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What?
L66470 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I didn't shoot West...
L66468 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
L66467 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why do you care?
L66466 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ But you will.
L66465 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
L66464 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
L66463 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
L66462 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
L66461 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
L66460 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
L66459 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Watch me.
L66458 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
L66457 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
L66456 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
L66449 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ I don't know.
L66448 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
L66417 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
L66416 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
L66415 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
L66414 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
L66413 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
L66412 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ I don't think that has anything to do with --
L66411 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ "Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
L66252 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I lied. Wait for it...
L66251 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
L66250 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
L66249 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ That was kid gloves?
L66237 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Got it.
L66236 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
L66232 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Not the happiest of memories?
L66231 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Being back here. Gives me the willies.
L66230 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Something wrong?
L66229 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What point?
L66228 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ He's telling the truth, up to a point.
L66227 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
L66226 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
L66225 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ So noted.
L66224 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You're off to a late start.
L66223 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I plan to grow on you.
L66222 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
L66221 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ The very same.
L66220 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
L66218 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
L66217 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You're kidding.
L66216 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I lost a bet.
L66215 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Something like that. You?
L66214 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
L66213 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
L66212 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
L66211 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What is that?
L66210 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Best time for banal chit-chat.
L66209 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ We're in the middle of a murder case --
L66208 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You're right. We should sit in silence.
L66207 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
L66140 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
L66139 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You made me look like an idiot --
L66138 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
L66137 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Baseball?
L66133 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
L66132 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
L66102 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
L66101 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
L66099 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Something like that.
L66098 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Good cop/bad cop?
L66097 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
L66096 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
L66095 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ That is the most unprofessional --
L66094 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Is Dunbar cute?
L66093 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Excuse me?
L66092 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
L66091 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Why?
L66090 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Move him.
L66089 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Yes.
L66088 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ He's in interrogation?
L66087 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
L66086 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
L66085 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
L66084 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
L66083 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
L66082 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
L66081 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
L66080 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
L66079 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
L66078 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
L66077 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
L66076 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You and the Colonel go back.
L66075 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
L66061 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
L66060 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
L66059 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I didn't mean that as a compliment.
L66056 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
L66055 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You knew Sergeant West?
L66054 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Ah, Christ
L66051 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
L66050 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Hostile and uncooperative.
L66608 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
L66607 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Pike, please --
L66392 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
L66391 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I don't think I want to hear this --
L66390 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
L66389 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ How?
L66388 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
L66387 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L66386 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
L66592 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
L66591 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ So you took off your shirt?
L66590 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ I was freezing from the hurricane --
L66361 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
L66360 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Oh, you remember now --
L66359 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ I remember now, it was before the explosion --
L66358 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Yeah and he doesn't know when --
L66357 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Pike and I got separated --
L66354 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
L66353 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Poor fucker my ass...
L66352 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
L66278 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
L66277 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ We should tell him we're not going.
L66274 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
L66273 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
L66272 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ The faggot speaks.
L66271 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Maybe we shouldn't go.
L66738 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
L66737 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What happened with Nunez?
L66735 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
L66734 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
L66733 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
L66725 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Childs.
L66724 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Who, Levi --
L66720 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
L66719 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Wrong answer --
L66718 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Dunbar's telling the truth.
L66717 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What.
L66716 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Wait --
L66715 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Enjoy your flight to Washington --
L66714 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
L66713 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ It won't work --
L66710 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ What?
L66709 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
L66706 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ You can't threaten me --
L66705 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
L66681 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
L66680 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Dunbar says you were.
L66677 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
L66676 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Pike never confessed.
L66669 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
L66668 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Fifty minutes.
L66667 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
L66666 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ We've been making progress, I see.
L66665 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Pike never confessed.
L66400 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
L66399 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ But you didn't see it, right?
L66398 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Because he'd shot Mueller.
L66397 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
L66289 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ He whispered it in my ear.
L66288 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ No one else heard it?
L66287 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ "You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
L66286 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ He said what?
L66264 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ He wanted more than that.
L66263 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
L66246 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
L66245 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ We just want --
L66606 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ -- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
L66605 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Tell him to shut up --
L66600 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Shut up!
L66599 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
L66598 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Bullshit --
L66597 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
L66596 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ The fuck are you talking about --
L66595 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
L66594 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ We're not going anywhere.
L66593 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
L66589 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
L66588 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ I used it to start the fire --
L66587 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Where's your shirt, Mueller?
L66586 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
L66582 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
L66581 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
L66579 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ What the fuck are you doing?
L66578 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Thank God...
L66515 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
L66514 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
L66502 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
L66501 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ What the fuck happened to you --
L66270 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
L66269 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
L66815 +++$+++ u484 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
L66814 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ So?
L66811 +++$+++ u484 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
L66810 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
L66809 +++$+++ u484 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
L66807 +++$+++ u484 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
L66806 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Yeah.
L66805 +++$+++ u484 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
L67038 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ The army kicked you out for drugs...
L67037 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You never told me why you got kicked out of...
L66783 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
L66782 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What happens to Dunbar now?
L66661 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
L66660 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ We know.
L66659 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
L66658 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
L66657 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ You want Kendall, don't you?
L66410 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ It's too neat.
L66409 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ What do you think?
L66142 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ No --
L66141 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ You think he did it?
L66068 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
L66067 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
L66039 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Then it's unofficial.
L66038 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ He's not Army, it's not official --
L66037 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
L66036 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
L66035 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
L66034 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ This is totally unnecessary --
L66283 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!
L66282 +++$+++ u486 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ THE CADETS +++$+++ Sir, yes, sir!
L66281 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
L66157 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
L66156 +++$+++ u486 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ THE CADETS +++$+++ Sir, yes, sir!
L66155 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
L66154 +++$+++ u486 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ THE CADETS +++$+++ Sir, yes, sir!
L66153 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
L66152 +++$+++ u486 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ THE CADETS +++$+++ Sir, yes, sir!
L66151 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
L84067 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Good luck, kid.
L84066 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Thank you.
L84065 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
L84064 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ There's only one I want.
L84063 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
L84062 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ That would explain the indigestion.
L84061 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
L84060 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Didn't kill anything, did I?
L84045 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.
L84044 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
L84043 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
L84041 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
L84040 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Someone stole my backpack.
L84039 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
L84038 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
L84037 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ What do you mean? You don't even know me.
L84036 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
L84035 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Who is she? Where does she live?
L84034 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
L84033 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Yes!
L84032 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
L84031 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
L84030 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
L84029 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
L84028 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ See! The big guy likes it.
L84024 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ That's great.
L84023 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
L84021 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
L84020 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Great, great. That's fantastic.
L83943 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I don't expect to.
L83942 +++$+++ u489 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ BEAMEN +++$+++ You won't find a better place!
L83939 +++$+++ u489 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ BEAMEN +++$+++ No one's ever left.
L83938 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
L83937 +++$+++ u489 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ BEAMEN +++$+++ Why?
L83936 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I have to leave. Tonight.
L83899 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ It truly is.
L83898 +++$+++ u489 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ BEAMEN +++$+++ Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
L83896 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
L83895 +++$+++ u489 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ BEAMEN +++$+++ He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
L83894 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ The poet? What ever happened to him?
L83893 +++$+++ u489 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ BEAMEN +++$+++ The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
L83892 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ What is this place?
L83886 +++$+++ u489 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ BEAMEN +++$+++ Not yet.
L83885 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You were expecting me?
L83884 +++$+++ u489 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ BEAMEN +++$+++ Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
L83883 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Yes.
L83882 +++$+++ u489 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ BEAMEN +++$+++ Bloom like a flower?
L83881 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Edward Bloom.
L83880 +++$+++ u489 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ BEAMEN +++$+++ Welcome to ya. What's your name?
L84093 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
L84092 +++$+++ u490 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DON PRICE +++$+++ What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
L84091 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Don.
L84090 +++$+++ u490 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DON PRICE +++$+++ Bloom!
L83739 +++$+++ u490 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DON PRICE +++$+++ Let's see it.
L83738 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I brought it.
L83737 +++$+++ u490 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DON PRICE +++$+++ You get the eye?
L83733 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Fine, I'm doing it.
L83732 +++$+++ u490 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DON PRICE +++$+++ Fine, you do it.
L83731 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Fine, I will.
L83730 +++$+++ u490 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DON PRICE +++$+++ Then do it.
L83729 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I'll go in right now and get that eye.
L83728 +++$+++ u490 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DON PRICE +++$+++ Or are you too scared?
L84364 +++$+++ u491 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DR. BENNETT +++$+++ Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
L84363 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No.
L84362 +++$+++ u491 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DR. BENNETT +++$+++ Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
L84361 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
L84360 +++$+++ u491 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DR. BENNETT +++$+++ Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
L84359 +++$+++ u491 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DR. BENNETT +++$+++ Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
L84358 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How would you describe him?
L84357 +++$+++ u491 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DR. BENNETT +++$+++ Thirty years. Maybe more.
L84356 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How long have you known my father?
L84355 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
L84354 +++$+++ u491 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DR. BENNETT +++$+++ Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
L83774 +++$+++ u491 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DR. BENNETT +++$+++ Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
L83773 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Can I see him?
L83767 +++$+++ u491 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DR. BENNETT +++$+++ A pleasure.
L83766 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
L83765 +++$+++ u491 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ DR. BENNETT +++$+++ Will.
L84318 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
L84317 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Lucky girl.
L84316 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
L84315 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I know.
L84314 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
L84307 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Go.
L84306 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I'll...
L84305 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Please. Go. Just go.
L84304 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Lord, I'm sorry I...
L84303 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I can get it. I can just...
L84302 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ It's okay, just leave it.
L84300 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I see. I thank you for your time.
L84299 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
L84298 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
L84297 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
L84295 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
L84294 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I'm not convinced you should be happy.
L84293 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Helping people makes me happy.
L84291 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
L84290 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
L84289 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ In so many words, yes.
L84287 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
L84286 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ So I've heard.
L84285 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
L84284 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
L84283 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ How did you know?
L84282 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ You must be Edward Bloom.
L83945 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
L83944 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Promise me you'll come back.
L83941 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I suspect it will hurt a lot.
L83940 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
L83931 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
L83930 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You're pretty good at arithmetic.
L83929 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
L83928 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Eighteen.
L83927 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ How old are you?
L83924 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
L83923 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Yeah.
L83922 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Was she nekkid?
L83921 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Well, she... uh...
L83920 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ What did she look like?
L83919 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Did you see that woman?
L84115 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ And I like you.
L84114 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I like your stories.
L84113 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
L84112 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ You were talking about your wedding.
L84111 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ There was one time when I was eleven...
L84110 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
L84109 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
L84108 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
L84107 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
L84011 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Well, it's not a short one.
L84010 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Oh, so this is a tall tale?
L84009 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
L84008 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I never knew.
L84007 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
L84004 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Please?
L84003 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
L84002 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Can I take your picture?
L84001 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Spooning the sherbet.
L83999 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
L83998 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Stop.
L83997 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
L83995 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ He was slipping her a little extra cream.
L83994 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ No, I understand.
L83993 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
L83991 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.
L83990 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ That's terrible.
L83989 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
L83987 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ What were you dreaming about?
L83986 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I was dreaming.
L83985 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Hi. How are you feeling?
L83958 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
L83957 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Really.
L83875 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
L83874 +++$+++ u495 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ You're not trying to run away?
L83873 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
L83872 +++$+++ u495 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ You know anyone's who's taken it?
L83869 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Beats me.
L83868 +++$+++ u495 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ What did she say?
L83860 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Okay.
L83859 +++$+++ u495 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Okay.
L83858 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
L83857 +++$+++ u495 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ You don't like it?
L83856 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
L83855 +++$+++ u495 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Karl.
L83854 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ What's your name, Giant?
L83853 +++$+++ u495 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
L83852 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
L83851 +++$+++ u495 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I can.
L83850 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
L83849 +++$+++ u495 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Really?
L83848 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
L84408 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Yes. Exactly.
L84407 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
L84402 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Story of my life.
L84401 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's unbelievable.
L84398 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ The River!
L84397 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You say...
L84396 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Where are we headed?
L84383 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
L84382 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Let's get out of here.
L84378 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Okay. Okay.
L84377 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Like this.
L84376 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
L84373 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ How I go.
L84372 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How what happens?
L84371 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Tell me how it happens.
L84370 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The river?
L84369 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ The river.
L84193 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
L84192 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
L84191 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
L84190 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ It would kill you, huh?
L84189 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
L84188 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
L84187 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You think I'm fake.
L84186 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
L84185 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
L84184 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
L84183 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
L84182 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
L84181 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
L84180 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
L84179 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ What?
L84178 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Dad!
L84177 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
L84176 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
L84173 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Can we talk?
L84172 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Son?
L84171 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Dad?
L84170 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
L84168 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I think someone hasn't.
L84167 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
L84166 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yes.
L84165 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Did I ever tell you about how...
L83962 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Oh, so you know.
L83961 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
L83960 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
L83959 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Why not religion, Dad?
L83814 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
L83813 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I thought you weren't dying.
L83811 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
L83810 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You know where the chemicals are?
L83809 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I will.
L83808 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
L83807 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
L83806 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You mean, while I'm here.
L83805 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
L83803 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You're right.
L83802 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ There's a lot you don't know about me.
L83801 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ When did you ever work in an office?
L83800 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ True story.
L83799 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Really.
L83798 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You owe me three-fifty.
L83797 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What did he say?
L83796 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
L83795 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Okay.
L83794 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
L83793 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
L83792 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ So how does it happen?
L83791 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
L83790 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
L83789 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ She was a witch.
L83788 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The Old Lady by the swamp.
L83787 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
L83786 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Really.
L83785 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
L83783 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You learned from the best.
L83782 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You think I'm up for it?
L83781 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
L83780 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Did you do any of that?
L83779 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
L83778 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Am I?
L83777 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You --  -- are in for a surprise.
L83705 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'm not scared.
L83704 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
L83703 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The one about the witch.
L83675 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
L83674 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
L83673 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
L83672 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Jesus Christ.
L83671 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
L83670 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
L83659 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Make him stop.
L83658 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
L84239 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
L84238 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I was drying out.
L84104 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Go out with me.
L84103 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ How can I convince you to stop?
L84086 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I have the rest of my life to find out.
L84085 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ You don't even know me.
L84084 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
L84083 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ How did you get so many?
L84082 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ They're your favorite flower.
L84081 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Daffodils?
L84074 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
L84073 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Oh.
L84071 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
L84070 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L84229 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
L84228 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ 'Fraid so.
L84227 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ This is it? The whole vault.
L84218 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ I'm robbing this place.
L84217 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ So what are you up to now?
L84216 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
L84215 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
L84214 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I don't believe it!
L84213 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
L84212 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ It's me. Norther Winslow.
L83915 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
L83914 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ I can't imagine any place better than here.
L83913 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
L83912 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ This is why you don't show work in progress.
L83910 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
L83909 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Really.
L83908 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
L83903 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ There is no softer ground than town.
L83902 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Wait! I need those!
L84326 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
L84325 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You didn't become crazy.
L84324 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
L84323 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
L84267 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
L84266 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
L84265 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Because he's dying.
L84264 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
L84263 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
L84262 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
L84261 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Were you and my father having an affair?
L84260 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
L84259 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How did you know my father?
L84255 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
L84254 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Are you Jenny Hill?
L84253 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I wasn't expecting you.
L84252 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Hello.
L84251 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Oh. Oh.
L84351 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
L84350 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I do.
L84349 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Do you like it, being pregnant?
L84348 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
L84347 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
L84200 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I need to lie down for a bit.
L84199 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I'm going to check on him.
L84175 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I'll help you.
L84174 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I'm going to get started on dishes.
L83955 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ We'll have to pick up a copy.
L83954 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
L83758 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
L83757 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Yes.
L83756 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
L84336 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Is he going to be okay?
L84335 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
L84334 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What happened?
L84164 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
L84163 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I need you on my side.
L84162 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ You're not.
L84161 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
L84160 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
L84159 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ But it's not true.
L84158 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
L84157 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Do you love him?
L84156 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
L84155 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Do you love your father?
L84154 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
L84153 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Mmm, what?
L84152 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mmm.
L84151 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ But it's romantic.
L84150 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ That's because most of it never happened.
L84149 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
L84148 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ They met at Auburn.
L84147 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ You never told me how your parents met.
L84146 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Did you?
L84145 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I talked with your father last night.
L83701 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I'm going with you.
L83700 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You don't have to.
L83699 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I'm going with you.
L83698 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Probably tonight.
L83697 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ You need to go.
L83696 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
L83695 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ It's bad.
L84346 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Yes. Thank you.
L84345 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
L84341 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ That's okay?
L84340 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
L84339 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
L84249 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
L84248 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ So you never bought any land.
L84247 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
L84246 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Did you and Dad have any other property?
L84245 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Yes?
L84244 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mom?
L84243 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
L84242 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Is he awake?
L84198 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
L84197 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ That really happened?
L83982 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Do you know who that is?
L83981 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
L83980 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Was she one of your teachers?
L83979 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
L83978 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
L83977 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
L83976 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
L83975 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
L83974 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
L83973 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
L83972 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Josephine and I have a lot in common.
L83971 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two.
L83970 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yes. But that's a different...
L83969 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Would you say you understand Josephine?
L83968 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
L83967 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
L83966 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Yes.
L83965 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
L83964 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Of course.
L83963 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
L83953 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Really! That's wonderful.
L83952 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
L83764 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
L83763 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How much time does he have left?
L83762 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
L83761 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How is he?
L83760 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ He's up with your father.
L83759 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
L83751 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
L83750 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We rented a car.
L83749 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
L83748 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
L83747 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ How did you get here?
L85802 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
L85801 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ The sets were good.
L85800 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
L85799 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ Yeah it was okay.
L85796 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ I paid for those guitar cases.
L85795 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
L85794 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
L85793 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ Such as?
L85792 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
L85791 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
L85790 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ No I don't.
L85789 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ You know what for.
L85788 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ What for?
L85787 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me ñ50.
L85783 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
L85782 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ You first.
L86050 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ No I haven't.
L86049 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
L86048 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Leave him!
L86047 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
L86045 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L86044 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ What? What are you doing?
L85832 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Name it.
L85831 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
L85829 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
L85828 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ What?
L85826 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ Thank you.
L85825 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Say thank you.
L85824 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ Yeah.
L85823 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Do you like it?
L85816 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ It is. I did it cooking.
L85815 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ That's not a burn.
L85814 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ It's nothing. I burnt myself.
L85813 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ What's this?
L85812 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ We'll stop then.
L85811 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85810 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ Do you want to stop?
L85809 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
L85808 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ What do you mean?
L85807 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ It's enough isn't it?
L85785 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ There's over eighty thousand here.
L85784 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
L85760 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Right.
L85759 +++$+++ u500 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ BRANCH MANAGER +++$+++ I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
L85758 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Hello.
L85710 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Uh... Yes.
L85709 +++$+++ u500 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ BRANCH MANAGER +++$+++ You can see why it's sensitive?
L85708 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Right.
L85707 +++$+++ u500 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ BRANCH MANAGER +++$+++ To customers approaching the bank from the rear
L85706 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Ch...
L85705 +++$+++ u500 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ BRANCH MANAGER +++$+++ This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
L85755 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Leave her alone.
L85754 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ I'm so sorry.
L85753 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Just leave her alone.
L85752 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
L85751 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
L85750 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh Jesus.
L85749 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
L85748 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
L85747 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
L85746 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ He wants the money from your bank.
L85745 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
L85744 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ He wants a lot of money.
L85743 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
L85742 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ He wants money.
L85741 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
L85740 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
L85739 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What did he say? Tell me!
L85738 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What? What does he want?
L85737 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
L85736 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
L85735 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ John.
L85734 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Put the fucking kettle down.
L85726 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Good night.
L85725 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
L85724 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You can stay tonight.
L85723 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ I understand. I'm so sorry
L85715 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
L85714 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
L85713 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ How is bank?
L85697 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
L85696 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
L85695 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Do you believe in love?
L85694 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No. It's not that.
L85693 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
L85692 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
L85691 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Tell me what he said.
L85690 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ No. It is too judgmental.
L85689 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Tell me.
L85688 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Oh nothing.
L85687 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What was that?
L85682 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
L85681 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Binoculars.
L85680 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ "I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
L85679 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I...
L85678 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ "I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
L85677 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ When?
L85675 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What?
L85674 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ She says she has a secret to tell.
L85671 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
L85670 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Uh. Do you like England?
L85669 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
L85665 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No, no...
L85664 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ You're asking for my documents?
L85663 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You must have a visa or something...
L85662 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
L85661 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ So how long will you be in England?
L85659 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
L85658 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
L85657 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What was that?
L85656 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
L85655 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ So?
L85654 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
L85653 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No.
L85651 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
L85650 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Right.
L85649 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ We better watch him. He's crazy.
L85648 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Right.
L85647 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
L85646 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
L85644 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
L85643 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Hold on.
L85642 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
L85641 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ And...
L85640 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Good. 
L85639 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yes. I know.
L85638 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Oh.  We are Russian.
L85637 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I need to know who you are first please.
L85635 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ He says he feels safe here.
L85634 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What did he say?
L85629 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ What?
L85628 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm asking what you're here for.
L85627 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Sorry. You've lost me...
L85626 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L85625 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
L85624 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
L85623 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
L86104 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
L86103 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ My name's Sophia.
L86090 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Right.
L86089 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
L86088 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Maybe you will find out.
L86087 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What does it mean?
L86084 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Tell me about it.
L86083 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It's a long way to go for a date.
L86082 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ It's more like a date.
L86081 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No. What? No. I know.
L86080 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I'm not asking you to marry me.
L86079 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Why?
L86076 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ It's what you came back for.
L86075 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It's not mine either.
L86074 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ It's not mine.
L86071 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Please.
L86070 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L86069 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Whatever.
L86068 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
L86067 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Goodbye.
L86066 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
L86065 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You can probably buy them on the flight.
L86063 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Okay. Promise?
L86062 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Something else.
L86060 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Goodbye.
L86059 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Okay. Goodbye.
L86032 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Because it was a lie.
L86031 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Please. Why not?
L86030 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah. No thanks.
L86028 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Whatever.
L86027 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Okay. Thank you.
L86026 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No. I think I better just go.
L86025 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
L86024 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It's alright.
L86023 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You know you can come under the blanket.
L86021 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What's your name?
L86020 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ What was her name?
L86019 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't know.
L86017 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Except for Small Eyes.
L86016 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Except for Small Eyes.
L86015 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't want anyone to die.
L86014 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
L86013 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Nobody's that unhappy.
L86012 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
L86011 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I've got news for you. It's not working.
L86010 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I'm trying to quit.
L86009 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
L86008 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Laugh it up.
L86007 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ She's alive!! She is not dead?
L86006 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ She's alive?
L86005 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
L86004 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ What?
L86003 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
L86002 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L86000 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ She's dead.
L85999 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
L85998 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
L85997 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
L85996 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What?
L85995 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ What happened between you and the blonde?
L85991 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Not really. Maybe a little.
L85990 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Are you scared?
L85989 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ No.
L85988 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Have you had any before?
L85987 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ No.
L85986 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
L85984 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well what have you got?
L85983 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I don't have nothing.
L85982 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
L85981 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You are pretty naive if you think it is.
L85980 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Thank Christ for that.
L85979 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
L85978 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
L85977 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
L85976 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
L85975 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I wasn't saying anything.
L85974 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Please, there's no... Oh.
L85973 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ What? I... I wasn't saying...
L85972 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You don't have to say anything
L85971 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
L85965 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Get out.
L85964 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You are throwing me out.
L85963 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Get out
L85962 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Excuse me?
L85959 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You don't understand you either.
L85958 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You don't understand me.
L85957 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
L85956 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It wasn't what I wanted.
L85955 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You didn't mind too much.
L85954 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I got what I paid for.
L85953 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You...
L85952 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What?
L85951 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
L85950 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
L85949 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ So now you hate all women?
L85948 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
L85947 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Why?
L85946 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
L85945 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
L85944 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Some... What does that mean?
L85943 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Sometimes neither.
L85942 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Sometimes which?
L85941 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Sometimes.
L85940 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
L85938 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
L85937 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
L85936 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
L85935 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
L85934 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
L85933 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ And who says what is wrong.
L85932 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ And. It's wrong.
L85931 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ And? What are you saying?
L85930 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
L85929 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I don't hate you.
L85928 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
L85927 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ We'll pretend it never happened.
L85926 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Okay we won't talk about it.
L85925 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No.
L85924 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You don't want to talk about it.
L85923 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Shut up. I'm not listening.
L85922 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Why not?
L85921 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it.
L85918 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ No. But you tend to tie them up.
L85917 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
L85916 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
L85915 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Excuse me?
L85914 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ He will come back.
L85913 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
L85911 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ But, you know, so what?
L85910 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
L85909 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
L85908 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh Jesus.
L85907 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
L85906 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ So uh...
L85905 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
L85904 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ It's none of your business.
L85903 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Fine.
L85902 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I don't want to talk about him.
L85901 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
L85899 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I said I don't have any.
L85898 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What?
L85897 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I don't have any money.
L85896 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Give me some money.
L85894 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85893 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Shut up. Have you got your passport?
L85892 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ What?
L85891 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Have you got your passport?
L85890 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
L85878 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
L85877 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
L85876 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What? No you're not..
L85875 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
L85874 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What?
L85873 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Where's the restroom?
L85871 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
L85870 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
L85869 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ In every sense. If at all possible.
L85868 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ So you're just going to be vindictive
L85867 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I do. I want to very badly.
L85866 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ I know you just want to punish me --
L85865 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ In the world.
L85864 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ No I don't.
L85863 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
L85856 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well as it turns out I did.
L85855 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
L85854 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
L85853 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
L85852 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
L85851 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ So what are you going to do?
L85850 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
L85849 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
L85848 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't want to know.
L85847 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ It's makes it easier. Okay.
L85846 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
L85845 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
L85844 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You don't understand anything.
L85843 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
L85722 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ They go.
L85721 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
L85720 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ They go.
L85719 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What's wrong?
L85718 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ They go. John. They go.
L85632 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yes I know.
L85631 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ "Frenzy".
L85616 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
L85615 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Syevodnya
L85614 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Syevodnya?
L85612 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Happy bath day.
L85611 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't understand.
L85608 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Sorry?
L85607 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Today is bath day.
L85560 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85559 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Uh... Are you a giraffe?
L85558 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85557 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Do you follow or should I speak slower?
L85556 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85555 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Good. Or should I speak slower?
L85554 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85553 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
L85552 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85551 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
L85550 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85549 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
L85548 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85547 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
L85544 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
L85543 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85542 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
L85541 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85540 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
L85539 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85538 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
L85536 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Right. Okay. Good.
L85535 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85534 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Is that everything?
L86097 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Cash.
L86096 +++$+++ u503 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ How do you want to pay?
L86095 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Thanks.
L86094 +++$+++ u503 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ You have excellent English.
L86093 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
L86092 +++$+++ u503 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ OFFICIAL +++$+++ I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
L86091 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Is the flight full?

L86514 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
L86513 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ You didn't have to do this.
L86512 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
L86337 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Don't make it less true.
L86336 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.

L86334 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ Not if no one finds out.
L86333 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ This gonna get you in trouble?
L86332 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
L86331 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Oh, she older than that.
L86330 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ Is your niece older than 12?
L86326 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
L86325 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ You take her to a doctor?

L86317 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
L86316 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ You hurt it?
L86315 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
L86314 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Oh! Gave me a start.
L86313 +++$+++ u505 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ANGELA +++$+++ Lazarus?
L86210 +++$+++ u513 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ MAYELLA +++$+++ Don't gotta tell me. Me and my girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them hard fingertips he got pickin' that guitar.
L86209 +++$+++ u506 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ BOJO +++$+++ Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
L86208 +++$+++ u513 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ MAYELLA +++$+++ Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
L86205 +++$+++ u513 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ MAYELLA +++$+++ You seen my snake-skin shoes?
L86204 +++$+++ u506 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ BOJO +++$+++ Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
L86203 +++$+++ u513 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ MAYELLA +++$+++ Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
L86202 +++$+++ u506 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ BOJO +++$+++ He black alright, he just ain't blue.
L86271 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Okay.
L86270 +++$+++ u507 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Can I put it in your mouth?
L86269 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
L86268 +++$+++ u507 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ No, ma'am.
L86267 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You ain't the kicker, are you?
L86266 +++$+++ u507 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Hey.
L86265 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Hi.
L86508 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I'll take a jar of that, too.
L86507 +++$+++ u508 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ELLA MAE +++$+++ Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
L86506 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ For your hands?
L86505 +++$+++ u508 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ELLA MAE +++$+++ These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
L86504 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
L86502 +++$+++ u508 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ELLA MAE +++$+++ Well, that makes it easier.
L86501 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ That young lady's size, right'cher.
L86500 +++$+++ u508 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ELLA MAE +++$+++ And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
L86669 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Make yourself at home. You done it already.
L86668 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ You gonna steal my truck?
L86666 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
L86665 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
L86664 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
L86663 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
L86662 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
L86661 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Now wait...
L86660 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
L86659 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. Army'd pay for school. You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself.
L86658 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ That's not right, really, cuz I...
L86657 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
L86654 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared...  ...and run.
L86653 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
L86652 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
L86650 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ You need a ride?
L86649 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
L86648 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ You been home yet?
L86647 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
L86646 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ She's around. Always is.
L86645 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
L86644 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ I guess it could be worse. You could be comin' back in a body bag.
L86643 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
L86642 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ What happened?
L86628 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.
L86627 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Sure.
L86626 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ Sit down, man. Need a beer?
L86625 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L86624 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ Holy shit.
L86121 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ You gonna miss your bus.
L86120 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
L86109 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Yeah. Transmission's shot.
L86108 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ Still need a lift?
L86291 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You don't got half what Tehronne got.
L86290 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ The fuck you laughin' at?
L86289 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
L86288 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
L86287 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
L86286 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I got others.
L86285 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ Thought you had a skirt earlier.
L86282 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ Stop what?
L86281 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
L86260 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You go to hell.
L86259 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
L86258 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
L86250 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Yeah.
L86249 +++$+++ u510 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Better?
L86247 +++$+++ u510 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
L86246 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
L86245 +++$+++ u510 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You wanna go home?
L86238 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I begged him not to go. And he did.
L86237 +++$+++ u510 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
L86236 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
L86235 +++$+++ u510 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
L86231 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
L86230 +++$+++ u510 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
L86172 +++$+++ u517 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!

L86166 +++$+++ u517 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Let go...
L86165 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ God forgive you, for how you done me...
L86163 +++$+++ u517 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I don't love ya no more.
L86162 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...

L86153 +++$+++ u517 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
L86152 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
L86151 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ And you gonna live it with him?
L86150 +++$+++ u517 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.

L86146 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
L86145 +++$+++ u517 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Think this about money still, ya old fool?
L86144 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.

L86483 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
L86482 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.

L86477 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Uh-uh.
L86476 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?

L86355 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Now, hold up.
L86354 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
L86353 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
L86352 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
L86351 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Why you say that?
L86350 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ Shit. Who hasn't?
L86349 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ This Rae... you get with her?
L86348 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
L86347 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Huh?
L86346 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
L86345 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
L86344 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ You need some weed?
L86343 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Word wit'cha. In private.
L86342 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
L86932 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I do.
L86931 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
L86792 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
L86791 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.

L86674 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Then what?
L86673 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Not like that.
L86672 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
L86671 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
L86670 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
L86622 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Ask the chef.
L86621 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
L86618 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ This all looks wonderful.

L86573 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ One thing at a time, Laz.
L86572 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
L86571 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?

L86567 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
L86566 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ What's that chain around her for?
L86565 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
L86564 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
L86563 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
L86562 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
L86561 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
L86560 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ A naked woman, chained in ya house?
L86559 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
L86558 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
L86552 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I told you to TURN BACK!
L86551 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Or what?
L86550 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
L86549 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Ain't gonna be moved?
L86548 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
L86546 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
L86545 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
L86544 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Goin' dove huntin'?
L86543 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
L86542 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
L86541 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ You get a call from Rose?
L86540 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
L86539 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Why's his britches round his knees?
L86538 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
L86537 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
L86300 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
L86299 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Don't know if God wanna see me.
L86298 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
L86297 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
L86296 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
L86135 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I didn't start this, R.L.
L86134 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
L86133 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
L86132 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
L86620 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
L86619 +++$+++ u512 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LINCOLN +++$+++ I skipped lunch.
L86583 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ You struck some gold, didn't ya?
L86582 +++$+++ u512 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LINCOLN +++$+++ Yes'sir.
L86581 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ So...  That your first time?
L86580 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
L86579 +++$+++ u512 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LINCOLN +++$+++ Please don't tell my daddy.
L86578 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
L86577 +++$+++ u512 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LINCOLN +++$+++ Why she got a chain on her?
L86576 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
L86199 +++$+++ u512 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LINCOLN +++$+++ Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
L86198 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Keep the change on that.
L86197 +++$+++ u512 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LINCOLN +++$+++ Yes'sir.
L86196 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Get me ten bags of mulch.
L86195 +++$+++ u512 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LINCOLN +++$+++ You won't at the square this mornin'.
L86885 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
L86884 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
L86596 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
L86595 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
L86594 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ What's on your mind?
L86593 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
L86592 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ You could put it that way.
L86591 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
L86590 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ That's right.
L86589 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You a preacher?
L86588 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
L86587 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
L86586 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
L86585 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Thank you.
L86851 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Ronnie...
L86850 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
L86849 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
L86848 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Ronnie. Please, baby...
L86847 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
L86826 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Yeah, I do.
L86825 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I feel better. Do you?
L86821 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
L86820 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I'm a what?
L86819 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
L86818 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ What?
L86817 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Holy shit!
L86816 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ No. I just got a messed up stomach.
L86815 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Are you wasted?
L86814 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
L86813 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
L86812 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Yeah?
L86811 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
L86810 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
L86809 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
L86808 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ You feelin' sick?
L86807 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
L86806 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
L86805 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Hey.
L86804 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Hey.
L86119 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Rae!
L86118 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
L86117 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Rae don't do this now...
L86116 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
L86115 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Rae...
L86114 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ This ain't gonna work.
L86751 +++$+++ u518 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
L86750 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
L86749 +++$+++ u518 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
L86748 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
L86747 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.  I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had.
L86746 +++$+++ u518 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ The hell are you talkin' about?
L86745 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
L86744 +++$+++ u518 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ All that shit's on aisle 5.
L86743 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I just wanted some make-up.

L86741 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
L86740 +++$+++ u518 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
L86739 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
L86738 +++$+++ u518 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You need money again?
L86737 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
L86736 +++$+++ u518 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L86735 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Got in a little accident.
L86734 +++$+++ u518 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ What happened to your face?

L86192 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Didn't know you was workin' here now?
L86185 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ Eh, if the bootie fits...
L86184 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ The hell you call me?
L86183 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ Alright. How much you need, ho?
L86182 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.

Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?

L86174 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You got any money?
L87249 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
L87248 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
L87247 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
L87246 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
L87245 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
L87220 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't think he'd feel it.
L87219 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
L87204 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Maybe we should bail?
L87203 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'd feel better if we had some heat.
L87202 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Getting very weird.
L87200 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I hope not.
L87199 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ This the right place?
L87196 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You said that in the last two places.
L87195 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ This should be it...
L87193 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ First decent idea you've had.
L87192 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Let's grab some food.
L87191 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
L87188 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I said let's go, Charlie.
L87187 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Nick, we can't just --
L87186 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Let's go.
L87164 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ In Rome, I'll bow.
L87163 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hey, when in Rome --
L87162 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
L87152 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.
L87151 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I didn't know.
L87150 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
L87149 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
L87148 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Go to sleep, Charlie.
L87147 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
L87146 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Number five with a bullet.
L87145 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Nick, have I been a good partner?
L87144 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No.
L87143 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Nick... You up?
L87141 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Where is the subway station, please.
L87140 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What'd you say?
L87137 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
L87136 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Not a prayer.
L87135 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
L87134 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.
L87133 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Beats forty hours on a plane.
L87132 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
L87131 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
L87130 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
L87082 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Saving your life.
L87081 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L87078 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
L87077 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Maybe we should do something?
L87076 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Some party.
L87075 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ The Wolf?
L87074 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Frank Abolofia.
L87073 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What?
L87072 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
L87070 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
L87069 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
L87068 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Who do you think the Jap is?
L87067 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
L87066 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What are they doing now?
L87063 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ -- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
L87062 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
L87061 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ -- I should tear your head off.
L87060 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
L87046 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Charlie...
L87045 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
L87044 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
L87043 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
L87042 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Why?
L87041 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Get rid of it.
L87040 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Back-up.
L87039 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Let go...
L87038 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What's this?
L87037 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
L87036 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
L87034 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ -- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
L87033 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
L87032 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Home.
L87031 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hey, hey, where you goin'?
L87030 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Thanks.
L87029 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
L87020 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
L87019 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
L87018 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I think she got to you, pappy.
L87278 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hey, all right.
L87277 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ What does Charlie mean?
L87276 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
L87275 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You all right?  You okay?
L87274 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Cool?
L87273 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You cool, Ich?
L87238 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
L87237 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What'd she say?
L87236 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Joyce can be nice.
L87226 +++$+++ u520 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
L87225 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Squid?
L87058 +++$+++ u521 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ I wasn't expecting you.
L87057 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Are you expecting anyone?
L87056 +++$+++ u521 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ If you give me one.
L87055 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Give me a break, would you?
L87054 +++$+++ u521 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ You'll take care of that.
L87053 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ High spirits, desire, commitment.
L87052 +++$+++ u521 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ All right, how's the new partner?
L87051 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Connie...
L87050 +++$+++ u521 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
L87049 +++$+++ u521 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ CONNIE +++$+++ Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
L87048 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Short shift?
L87652 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ How can you be so sure?
L87651 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ We can't lose.
L87650 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Think we'll get him, Nick?
L87641 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
L87640 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Louder, pal, louder.
L87628 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Call for help.
L87627 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Yes...
L87626 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You all right?
L87621 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
L87620 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why's that?
L87619 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ You know, Nick, we can't lose.
L87617 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Luck.
L87616 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What's that for?
L87614 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Me too.
L87613 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L87612 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ A wife.  She left.
L87611 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Thank you.  You have one?
L87609 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
L87608 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Someone attacked him.
L87605 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ We need the plate to negotiate with.
L87604 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ I don't know.
L87603 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Joyce?
L87602 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ I couldn't tell.
L87601 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How many men?
L87600 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
L87599 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
L87567 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
L87566 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You did great, Ichiro.
L87564 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Kampai.
L87563 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Just one, compadre... Kampai.
L87531 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ I can't...
L87530 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Start it.
L87528 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
L87527 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ No.
L87526 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
L87524 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's done.  You don't have to come.
L87523 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Nick, you can't do this.
L87522 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Let's go.  Him first.
L87521 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ No...
L87486 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ So I bring some cheese?
L87485 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
L87484 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What's in the box?
L87449 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
L87448 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
L87447 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ It's illegal, Nick.
L87446 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Big enough.
L87445 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ It's very small.
L87443 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
L87442 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
L87441 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Because he knows how to get to our man.
L87440 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ What...?  Why?
L87439 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I want to go talk to him.
L87438 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ A resort city, Beppu.
L87437 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Where does this Sugai live?
L87424 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
L87423 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Nick!
L87412 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ San is an honorable title.
L87411 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
L87410 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
L87409 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I want to yank Kobo.
L87408 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ ... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
L87406 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Shut-up.
L87405 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Nick --
L87404 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
L87403 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ I'm not drunk...
L87398 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ You can trust me.
L87397 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
L87396 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ I'll check it out.
L87395 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Gaiijin.
L87394 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ You can't come in.  They don't want --
L87390 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ You were too far behind.
L87389 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ She disappeared... shit!
L87388 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Good.  Very good...
L87387 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Yakuza.
L87381 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
L87380 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
L87379 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Ichiro --
L87378 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
L87372 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
L87371 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
L87368 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
L87367 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Nick...
L87362 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Sure.
L87361 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
L87359 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Are we getting married?
L87358 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
L87357 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Did I say that?
L87355 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ There she is!
L87354 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What'd I tell you?
L87353 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Nick...
L87352 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
L87351 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
L87348 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
L87347 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
L87337 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
L87336 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What's he saying?
L87335 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ A snitch?
L87334 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
L87333 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Know her?
L87329 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ I stole them.
L87328 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How'd you get this?
L87324 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I can see that.
L87323 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ I've continued working on the case!
L87300 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ I'll get him for you, Nick.
L87299 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yeah...
L87298 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ You must leave?
L87297 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
L87296 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why weren't you at the platform?
L87295 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
L87294 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
L87293 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What happened?
L87272 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ I don't, that's all.
L87271 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why the hell not?
L87270 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
L87269 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
L87253 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
L87252 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ It's Ichiro.  Ich.
L87251 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Give us a break...
L87250 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Nick!
L87240 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What's the problem here?
L87239 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ ... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
L87217 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
L87216 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
L87215 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
L87214 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ "Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
L87213 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
L87212 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Where're you going, Ichiro?
L87210 +++$+++ u522 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ ICH +++$+++ Where would you look for the mafia?
L87209 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Where do we start looking for this guy?
L87638 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'd like that.
L87637 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
L87636 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Might be different in New York.
L87635 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
L87634 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Can't make you change your mind?
L87549 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
L87548 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What if I chant?
L87547 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ I still think you're a bastard.
L87543 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why would you care?
L87542 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
L87541 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No one's keeping him here.
L87540 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ You'll get Ich killed.
L87492 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ The cheese...
L87491 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ We're in?
L87480 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Tell them I'm not.
L87479 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
L87478 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Who am I supposed to be?
L87477 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ They want your autograph.
L87476 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I don't remember you saying no.
L87475 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ I don't remember saying yes.
L87474 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
L87473 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ 'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
L87472 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What do you chant?
L87471 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
L87468 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ You met her.
L87467 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Where's the wife?
L87464 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ He's got a reason.
L87463 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ He drinks.
L87462 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ You're wrong to sell Ich short.
L87461 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You could fake it.
L87460 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ And I'm supposed to care?
L87459 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
L87458 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
L87457 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I need someone to translate for me.
L87456 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
L87455 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Unavailable.
L87454 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Where's Ich?
L87453 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I need your help, Joyce.
L87452 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
L87451 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
L87385 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ I paid for that.
L87384 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ He's on duty.
L87383 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Don't be an ass.
L87377 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
L87376 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ She ever pull down her shades?
L87321 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ I don't think so.
L87320 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
L87319 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
L87318 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You have a helluva way of answering.
L87317 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ You have a helluva way of asking for help.
L87316 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
L87315 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ I don't give tours.
L87314 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
L87313 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
L87312 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Gaiijin?
L87311 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Dead gaiijin's are big news.
L87309 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ There was a change in plans.
L87308 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Ich said you left.
L87230 +++$+++ u523 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ He gets as much as he wants.
L87229 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Don't give him any more.
L87584 +++$+++ u524 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ KOBO +++$+++ Then take it from him.
L87583 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
L87579 +++$+++ u524 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ KOBO +++$+++ Don't be.
L87578 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'm amused.
L87577 +++$+++ u524 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ KOBO +++$+++ This is my stop.
L87575 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Time, I've got plenty of.
L87574 +++$+++ u524 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ KOBO +++$+++ She's such a long way home for you.
L87573 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Guess I'm on a roll.
L87572 +++$+++ u524 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ KOBO +++$+++ I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
L87571 +++$+++ u524 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ KOBO +++$+++ You are a lucky man.  Where you come from a man can stand out.  It's expected.  Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
L87570 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Save it, I already took the tour.
L87569 +++$+++ u524 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ KOBO +++$+++ Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
L87417 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'm taking you back.
L87416 +++$+++ u524 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ KOBO +++$+++ Keep the change.
L87643 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Right.
L87642 +++$+++ u527 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ ... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
L87291 +++$+++ u527 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.
L87290 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ He killed a police officer.
L87289 +++$+++ u527 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
L87288 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I planned on catching him, Captain.
L87287 +++$+++ u527 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
L87286 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ He was my partner.
L87285 +++$+++ u527 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ It's not your job.
L87127 +++$+++ u527 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
L87126 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why me?
L87125 +++$+++ u527 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
L87124 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What...?  What if I say no?
L87123 +++$+++ u527 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
L87121 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What?
L87120 +++$+++ u527 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
L87119 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why?
L87118 +++$+++ u527 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
L87100 +++$+++ u527 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
L87099 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yeah.
L87098 +++$+++ u527 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ One guy do all the damage?
L87095 +++$+++ u527 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.
L87094 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Not in that company.
L87093 +++$+++ u527 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Dope?
L87092 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ This by this...
L87091 +++$+++ u527 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ How big a package we talking about?
L87594 +++$+++ u526 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OHASHI +++$+++ Goodbye, officer.
L87593 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I have to get to Sugai.
L87592 +++$+++ u526 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OHASHI +++$+++ -- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
L87591 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ If anything happens to her while I'm here --
L87590 +++$+++ u526 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OHASHI +++$+++ You had my help, detective.
L87589 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
L87588 +++$+++ u526 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OHASHI +++$+++ Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
L87432 +++$+++ u526 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OHASHI +++$+++ Twenty-four hours, detective.
L87431 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
L87428 +++$+++ u526 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OHASHI +++$+++ Look.
L87427 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
L87426 +++$+++ u526 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OHASHI +++$+++ Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
L87425 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What's this?
L87259 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
L87258 +++$+++ u526 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OHASHI +++$+++ The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
L87257 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Because I want you to tell me.
L87256 +++$+++ u526 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OHASHI +++$+++ Why don't you ask your chief detective?
L87255 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Could you fill me in?
L87184 +++$+++ u526 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OHASHI +++$+++ Do you know what this is?
L87183 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
L87182 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Work with me.  I want your best detective.
L87181 +++$+++ u526 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OHASHI +++$+++ You're foreigners.
L87180 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ We're police officers.
L87179 +++$+++ u526 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OHASHI +++$+++ It is not allowed.
L87178 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I want a gun.
L87177 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
L87176 +++$+++ u526 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ OHASHI +++$+++ You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
L87561 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
L87560 +++$+++ u528 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ SUGAI +++$+++ You want him dead too.
L87559 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ That wasn't our deal.
L87537 +++$+++ u528 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ SUGAI +++$+++ He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
L87536 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Good.
L87518 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I don't have to.
L87517 +++$+++ u528 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ SUGAI +++$+++ You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
L87516 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ If I say no?
L87515 +++$+++ u528 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ SUGAI +++$+++ Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
L87514 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ With these?
L87513 +++$+++ u528 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ SUGAI +++$+++ I'll pay you.
L87512 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You trust me?
L87511 +++$+++ u528 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ SUGAI +++$+++ The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
L87510 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why tell me this?
L87509 +++$+++ u528 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ SUGAI +++$+++ Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
L87508 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ The Feds would be onto you in a month.
L87507 +++$+++ u528 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ SUGAI +++$+++ Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
L87506 +++$+++ u528 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ SUGAI +++$+++ Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
L87505 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ The families who control the casinos?
L87504 +++$+++ u528 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ SUGAI +++$+++ Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
L87503 +++$+++ u528 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ SUGAI +++$+++ He'll be dealt with.
L87502 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I want him.
L87501 +++$+++ u528 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ SUGAI +++$+++ I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.
L87499 +++$+++ u528 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ SUGAI +++$+++ -- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant.
L87498 +++$+++ u525 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
L87497 +++$+++ u528 +++$+++ m33 +++$+++ SUGAI +++$+++ Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
